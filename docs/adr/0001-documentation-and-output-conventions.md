# ADR-0001: Documentation & Output Conventions

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-08-06
- **Deciders:** Platform team
- **Related:** [ADR-0000](0000-platform-foundations.md), [ADR-0002](0002-tool-adoption.md), [ADR-0500](0500-observability.md)
- **Decides:** Docs, ADRs, logs, CLI output, and code comments adopt ISO 24495-1, the Google developer style, OTel log conventions, and clig.dev, with only the local deltas normative.

## Context

Four surfaces carry written language in this repository: ADRs and docs, structured logs, human CLI output, and code comments. Each has an audience that is half human and half LLM, and neither audience tolerates drift. Without a written style, scripts invent symbol vocabularies, logs interpolate context into message strings, docs accrete a dialect nobody recorded, and comments restate the code beside them.

Most of what a house style would say is already published. Re-deriving it produces a longer, unaudited rulebook.

## Decision drivers

1. **One style for humans and LLMs.** The rules must be greppable and mechanically checkable, not matters of taste.
2. **Adopt, don't restate.** A citation is shorter than a paraphrase, and a borrowed rule survives re-litigation where a house rule does not.
3. **Density is a correctness property.** A reader who skims a wordy ADR applies it wrongly. Length is the tax every future reader pays.
4. **Symbols are for humans, never for machines.** This line runs through every surface below.

## Considered options

| Option | Coverage | Maintenance | Why not |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| No written style | none | none | The default outcome is four dialects and no way to call a PR wrong |
| Write a complete house style guide | total | high — a second standards body to run | Duplicates Google, OTel, and clig.dev at lower quality, and drifts from them silently |
| **Adopt standards by reference; make only the deltas normative** | total | low — deltas are short | **Chosen** *(reasoned)* |
| Adopt [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119)/[8174](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8174) keywords for Rules | normative strength | low | Its `SHOULD`/`MAY` tiers invite negotiation. Every Rule here is binding; strength is carried by the enforcement annotation instead |

## Decision

### Adopted standards

| Surface | Adopted standard | Local delta (normative) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Prose / docs | [ISO 24495-1:2023](https://www.iso.org/standard/78907.html) plain language; [Google Developer Documentation Style Guide](https://developers.google.com/style) (present tense, active voice); [Diátaxis](https://diataxis.fr) genres | the density rules and banned constructs below; `ADR-XXXX` citation form; final-state facts; second person scoped by genre |
| ADR structure | [MADR](https://adr.github.io/madr/) section set | the fixed section order below; mandatory comparison table ([ADR-0000](0000-platform-foundations.md), principle 7) |
| Structured logs | [OTel Semantic Conventions](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/); [RFC 5424](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5424) severity | no symbols; context as attributes, never interpolated |
| CLI / human stdout | [clig.dev](https://clig.dev); POSIX Utility Conventions (exit codes, `--help`, `--version`) | the fixed `→ ✓ ✗ ⚠` vocabulary and 2-space sub-detail indent |
| Code comments | [Effective Go](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go), [Go Code Review Comments](https://go.dev/wiki/CodeReviewComments); [Google Style Guides](https://google.github.io/styleguide/) for TypeScript | the comment rules below |

Diátaxis classifies an ADR as **explanation plus reference**. It is not a tutorial and not a how-to: it records a decision and its constraints, and never walks a reader through a task.

### Genre decides the path

Diátaxis is adopted as the organising standard, so it organises the tree and not only the prose. A reader learns a document's genre from its path before opening it, and a document that does not fit a genre is a document whose purpose is unsettled.

| Path | Genre | Holds |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `docs/adr/` | explanation + reference | one decision per file |
| `docs/guide/` | how-to | a procedure someone executes |
| `docs/reference/` | reference | a lookup, a registry, or live state |
| `docs/*.md` | entry, and canonical registries | the ordered way in, and the documents this set cites by name as the only place a fact is recorded |

**The root is not a genre and is not a default.** A file sits at `docs/` only by being the set's entry point or a registry an ADR names as canonical — [`operational-surface.md`](../operational-surface.md) for components, [`adoption-path.md`](../adoption-path.md) for the reduction order, [`tool-register.md`](../tool-register.md) for tools ([ADR-0002](0002-tool-adoption.md)). Everything else takes a genre directory.

**Topic lives in the filename.** A directory holding one file groups nothing, and a filename repeated once per topic — four documents all called `runbook.md` — is four files a search cannot separate. The name states the subject and the directory states the genre, so `guide/secrets-runbook.md` is both without a nested tree.

A generated document names its generator in a comment on the second line, and is not hand-edited ([`security-baseline.md`](../security-baseline.md), [`reference/rules-index.md`](../reference/rules-index.md)).

**Second person follows the genre, not the repository.** Google's *you* addresses someone performing a task, which is the tutorial and how-to genres — `docs/dev-loop.md`, `docs/guide/break-glass.md`, and their neighbours, where it is the correct voice. An ADR addresses nobody. It states what is true of the platform, so its subject is the platform and its rules take the imperative of law: *deployments reference images by digest*, never *you reference images by digest*.

### ADR structure

Sections appear in this order. A section with nothing to say is omitted, not filled.

| # | Section | Contains |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Header | Status, Date, Deciders, Related, Decides |
| 2 | Context | The problem and the constraints inherited from earlier ADRs |
| 3 | Decision drivers | What is being optimised for, in priority order — see *A driver is a property, not an answer* |
| 4 | Considered options | A comparison table against the alternatives. Mandatory ([ADR-0000](0000-platform-foundations.md), principle 7) |
| 5 | Decision | Declarative. "We use X. We do not use Y." |
| 6 | Consequences | Positive, Negative / Risks. No `Follow-ups` — see *An ADR is law, not a plan* |
| 7 | Rules | Flat, greppable, normative bullets derived from the decision |

**The header's `Decides` line is one sentence, and it is the set's skim surface.** Density optimises total length at the cost of read rate: every sentence in an ADR is load-bearing, so there is nothing to skip and no way to read the set quickly. One declarative sentence per ADR restores that without loosening anything below it, and the [index](README.md)'s *Decides* column is the same line at index resolution. It states what is true of the platform, never what the document contains — *"Go is the backend language and TypeScript the frontend one"*, not *"chooses the languages"*.

The comparison table uses prose cells where every option answers the same questions. It is not a scoring grid: the trade-offs are qualitative, and numeric scores manufacture false precision. [ADR-0002](0002-tool-adoption.md) owns its depth and the grading its decisive cells carry.

[ADR-0000](0000-platform-foundations.md) is the one exemption. It chooses no technology, so it has no options to compare and no single decision to state; it carries the thesis, principles, process, prior art, and vocabulary instead. Every other ADR uses the order above.

### A driver is a property, not an answer

A driver states what the decision is being optimised for. It is written so that someone who does not yet know the outcome could apply it and reach one.

Two failures make a driver useless, and both read as reasoning:

| Failure | Example | Instead |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **The driver names its own answer** | "One repo-wide release version, because the repo ships as a unit" | "The unit of versioning is the unit of shipping" — the property, which the version line then follows from |
| **The driver caricatures the loser** | "Keyless over key management. A team this size should not operate a signing-key HSM" — when the alternative was a key in the secret store already running | State the property, and let the option lose on what it is |

Both failures produce a Considered options table whose verdicts cite a driver written to eliminate them. That is circular, and it reads as rigour.

The test: swap the chosen option for a rejected one and re-read the drivers. If they now sound wrong rather than unmet, they are describing the answer instead of the problem.

### An ADR is law, not a plan

An ADR states what is true of this platform. It never states what someone intends to do about it. **"Deployments reference images by digest" is law; "wire the digest check into CI" is a task.** Both describe something absent from the repo, so the difference is where the obligation sits.

| An ADR's Rule | A working-file task |
| --- | --- |
| Holds indefinitely | Completes, and is then deleted |
| Is violated by code | Is *unmet* by an empty repo, which is not a violation |
| Binds every reader, including a generated project's | Binds one person in one repo |
| A reviewer cites it to reject a PR | A reviewer cannot cite it at all |

**Planned work is not part of the committed record.** A tracked plan is inherited by every generated project, which then carries a queue belonging to someone else, and as per-engineer working state it makes one person's backlog everyone's merge conflict. A task belongs in the forge's issues ([ADR-0102](0102-source-control-and-ci.md)), which is where it has an assignee and a close condition.

A committed document therefore states the platform as it stands. It does not annotate a rule with how far along the rule is, and it does not link to a working file: a link that resolves in one clone dangles in every other.

### Density

An ADR is a high-density technical document. Every word carries meaning or is deleted.

| Rule | Test a reviewer applies |
| --- | --- |
| One idea per sentence | The sentence has one main clause |
| Delete what survives deletion | Remove a clause; if the meaning is unchanged, it stays removed |
| Table over prose | Three or more items sharing two or more attributes become a table |
| Bullets over prose | Three or more parallel items become a list |
| Paragraphs are short | Over roughly 60 words, the paragraph becomes a list or a table |
| No restatement | A fact appears in exactly one ADR. Elsewhere it is a link |
| Figurative language is limited to the [ADR-0000](0000-platform-foundations.md) vocabulary | Any other metaphor, analogy, or wordplay is cut |

### Numbers

A number is stated when the number **is** the decision. One test settles it:

> **If this number doubled, would the decision change?**

| Answer | Kind | Example | Treatment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Yes | **Threshold** | "any volume exceeding 50% of node disk", "funnel-query p95 above 2s" | Stated. Changing it is a reviewed act |
| Yes | **Measurement that set a value** | Tempo's measured peak, which sets its explicit limit ([ADR-0204](0204-resource-management.md)) | Stated **with its conditions and how to re-derive it**. If it drifts, the value it set is wrong and must change |
| Yes | **Count of what is on the page** | "the six forces below" | Stated. The reader checks it against the table beside it |
| No | **Illustrative figure** | a footprint quoted to show the platform dominates | **Not stated.** Say the shape: "the platform dominates the footprint" |
| No | **Count of live state elsewhere** | "~25 always-on components", "ten workflows under `.github/workflows/`" | **Not stated.** Name the thing and link to its registry |

The last two rot. Nothing forces their update, and a figure without a date reads as current, so a reader draws a conclusion that stopped being true. A count of components, files, ADRs, or services belongs to the registry that owns them — [`docs/operational-surface.md`](../operational-surface.md) for platform components, [`README.md`](README.md) for the ADR set.

### Versions

**A tool's release version is not stated.** Upgrading a dependency must not require editing an ADR, and a version in prose goes stale silently while the lockfile that contradicts it does not. The pin lives where a machine reads it — a lockfile, `.mise.toml`, or the chart that installs the thing.

Three kinds of number look like a tool version and are not:

| Stated | Kind | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Yes | **A specification or format version** | OpenAPI 3.1, OCI 1.1, UUIDv7, RFC 9562. It names the contract an option is judged against, not the implementation |
| Yes | **A licence identifier** | Apache-2.0, BUSL 1.1. The number is part of the licence's name |
| Yes | **A capability boundary the decision turns on** | "the referrers API arrived in Distribution's 3.x line". Stated as a **floor**, never a pin, so a later release keeps the sentence true |

Everything else is the tool's own business. A capability is described by what it does — "Forgejo mints per-job OIDC tokens for Actions" — because that stays true across upgrades, while "Forgejo v15.0 LTS does" stops being the reason anyone reads the line.

The argument almost never needs the figure. "A floor of a couple of dozen components, fixed regardless of service count" carries the same weight as an exact tally and cannot go stale. Where a figure is load-bearing, it is a threshold, or it states the conditions it was taken under and where to take it again.

### Banned constructs

| Banned | Example found in this repo | Write instead |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Chronology** — how the decision came to be | "It has since grown into a good workload directory" | The standing fact: what it is now |
| **The former state** | "Today this is done with `psql`, `curl`, and Temporal" | The problem, stated without a date |
| **Discovery narrative** | "it turned out to be exactly the floor plus the mock" | "It is the floor plus the mock" |
| **Retrospection about the ADR set** | "ADR-NNNN did not previously cover" | Cover it, silently |
| **Intensifiers** | `very`, `really`, `quite`, `actually`, `simply`, `just`, `of course`, `obviously`, `clearly` | Delete. If the claim needs an intensifier it is not established |
| **Hedges** | `arguably`, `essentially`, `basically`, `more or less`, `in practice` | Decide. A hedge is an unfinished decision ([ADR-0000](0000-platform-foundations.md)) |
| **Meta-commentary** | "It is worth knowing", "Note that", "It should be noted" | State the thing |
| **Rhetorical questions** | "But is the pod actually running the new code?" | The answer, as a statement |
| **Dated section headings** | `## Implementation (2026-07-26)` | An undated heading |
| **Planned work** — a `Follow-ups` list, a `TODO`, a roadmap | "`tools/lint-prose` for the intensifier and hedge lists" | Nothing. State the law and stop. A task belongs in an issue |
| **The implementation's status** | "tracked in", "not yet wired", "lands in a later phase", "the status quo", a count of what exists so far | The rule, unqualified. Whether the artefact exists is not the ADR's subject, and an option loses on its merits rather than on being what happens to run |
| **A link to an untracked file** | ``[`plan.md`](plan.md)`` | Nothing. The file is absent from every other clone |

Deleting a word is always in scope for a documentation PR and never needs its own justification.

### Line breaks and tables

**Markdown is not hard-wrapped.** One line per paragraph, list item, or table row; a line ends only where the content does. `MD013` is disabled in `.rumdl.toml` for this reason.

**Tables are compact**, never column-padded: one space inside each pipe, and a bare `---` delimiter regardless of column width. `MD060` enforces it and `mise run format:md` applies it.

Both rules protect the diff. Reflowing a paragraph or widening a column rewrites every line after it, so a one-word edit arrives as a whole-file change and review cannot see what changed. Padding also has to be redone by hand on every later edit, and a wrap column is a per-author choice, which is how a repo ends up with three of them.

The reader's line length is the reader's business: editors and renderers both soft-wrap.

### Structured logs

The message is a short lowercase phrase with no trailing punctuation and no symbols. All context is key-value attributes following OTel semantic conventions, never interpolated into the message string. This restates [ADR-0500](0500-observability.md) as a Rule; it is not a second decision.

### Human CLI output

Scripts speak a fixed four-symbol vocabulary:

- `→` a step is starting
- `✓` a step succeeded
- `✗` a fatal error
- `⚠` a warning — never bare `WARN`
- two-space indent for sub-detail under a step

No written standard fixes TUI symbols; the checkmark/arrow idiom is convention by imitation of npm, cargo, and kubectl. clig.dev is cited for the principle and the vocabulary is fixed here. `scripts/lib/log.sh` (`step`/`ok`/`fail`/`warn`) implements it — formatting only, no error swallowing.

### Code comments

The density and banned-construct rules above apply unchanged to comments.

| Rule | Rationale |
| --- | --- |
| Comments explain **why**, not what | The code states what. A comment that restates it is a second source of truth that rots |
| A comment that explains confusing code is a defect | Rewrite the code ([Kernighan & Plauger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elements_of_Programming_Style), *"Don't comment bad code — rewrite it"*) |
| Load-bearing constraints cite `ADR-XXXX` | The reader can reach the reasoning without archaeology |
| Present tense, full sentences for doc comments | Google / Effective Go |
| Go doc comments begin with the identifier name | Effective Go |
| No commented-out code | Git holds it |
| No changelog, author, or date comments | Git holds them |
| No decorative banners or section dividers | The file structure is the structure |
| `TODO` cites an issue or ADR, or it is not merged | An uncited `TODO` is the "temporary" that [ADR-0000](0000-platform-foundations.md) forbids |

### Template docs are final-state facts

**Scope: this template repository's own `docs/` only.** A project generated from it is a living system where ADR history, `Supersedes`/`Amends`, `Proposed → Accepted`, and real authored dates are legitimate.

**The ADR set is inherited wholesale.** A generated project clones it and it becomes that project's own record, so an ADR is written for the engineer maintaining the system, never for someone deciding whether to adopt it. Two consequences:

- **The subject is "this platform", not "this template".** Anything that reads correctly only in this repo — *we build a template*, *when not to use this*, *who should adopt this* — is selection guidance for a reader who has not decided yet. It belongs in the root `README.md`. The ADR states the position that was chosen.
- **`template` names an artefact, not the audience.** `services/_template/` and *the template default* are correct in any repo; *this template targets…* is not.
- **No doc under `docs/` links to the root `README.md`.** A generated project rewrites or deletes that file, so any reference into it is a link that rots and a fact that vanishes. Every term, test, and table an ADR relies on is stated in the ADR set itself.
- **The resulting overlap is expected**, and is not a violation of one-fact-one-place, which governs the ADR set. The README restates for a reader who has not decided yet; the ADR states for the engineer who now owns the result. Removing the duplication by deleting from the ADR is the wrong direction.

The template's snapshot obeys:

- **No change-history or evolution narrative.** Each decision is a standing fact plus its rationale, never its chronology.
- **No `Supersedes` / `Amends` chains.** Every ADR is current. One that must change is rewritten in place.
- **No `Proposed → Accepted` progression.** A shipped ADR reads `Accepted`.
- **A uniform date across the set**, so it reads as one design rather than accretion.
- **Full rewrite over patch.** A patched-in paragraph that clashes in voice is a defect even when factually correct.

### Numbering

ADR numbers are allocated in blocks of a hundred, one block per layer, sequential within the block. The first two digits carry the layer, so a new ADR lands in its block without renumbering the set. [`README.md`](README.md) holds the block map.

### Enforcement annotations

A Rule that is machine-checkable names the mechanism, so a reader can go and read the check.

| Annotation | Means |
| --- | --- |
| `(CI: <task>)` | a named `mise` task rejects the violation. The task, never the workflow file that calls it — [ADR-0102](0102-source-control-and-ci.md) makes the task the portable name and the workflow a thin caller |
| `(enforced: <policy>)` | admission control rejects it in the cluster, which CI cannot bypass |
| `(ref: <standard>)` | the adopted external standard is the rule |

**An unannotated Rule is not a weaker Rule.** The annotation is a pointer to a mechanism, not a status report on one, so its absence says only that no gate names this rule — the ordinary case, and the reason a human reads a diff. Marking rules as human-enforced would put the build state of the check inside the law, which is the thing *An ADR is law, not a plan* forbids.

The mechanism named is one the ADR set decides on. A task or policy that appears in no decision and nowhere in the repo is not an annotation, it is a wish, and it is left off.

## Consequences

### Positive

- The conventions are mostly links, so they are short and hard to argue with.
- "Follow OTel semconv, clig.dev, Google" is one instruction an LLM acts on without a bespoke rulebook.
- The banned-constructs table gives a reviewer a mechanical basis for rejecting prose, replacing taste with a citation.
- The density rules bound ADR length, which bounds the cost every future reader pays.

### Negative / Risks

- Adopted standards evolve upstream and a citation can drift. Mitigated by making only the deltas normative.
- Most of these rules are read by a person rather than a task. The banned-constructs list is written to be grep-shaped, so a linter is an addition rather than a redesign.
- Terse prose loses nuance a longer version would carry. Accepted: nuance that matters becomes a table row, and nuance that does not becomes deletion.

## Rules

- Prose follows the Google developer-docs voice (present tense, active) and ISO 24495-1 plain language, organised by Diátaxis genre. An ADR is explanation plus reference, never a tutorial. `(ref: Google dev-docs, ISO 24495-1, Diátaxis)`
- Second person is the voice of the tutorial and how-to genres. An ADR addresses no reader: it states what is true of the platform, and its Rules read as law rather than as instructions.
- Every word is load-bearing. A clause whose deletion does not change the meaning is deleted.
- Three or more items sharing two or more attributes are a table; three or more parallel items are a list.
- Intensifiers, hedges, meta-commentary, rhetorical questions, and chronology are not used in template docs. `(CI: lint:prose)`
- Figurative language is limited to the [ADR-0000](0000-platform-foundations.md) vocabulary.
- A number is stated only if doubling it would change the decision: a threshold, a measurement that set a value, or a count of what is on the same page. An illustrative figure becomes the shape it demonstrates, and a count of live state elsewhere becomes a link to its registry.
- A tool's release version is not stated. A specification version, a licence identifier, and a capability boundary stated as a floor are not tool versions. The pin lives in the lockfile, `.mise.toml`, or the chart.
- A fact appears in exactly one ADR. Every other mention is a link.
- Markdown is not hard-wrapped: one line per paragraph, list item, or table row. `(CI: lint:md)`
- Tables are compact — one space inside each pipe, a bare `---` delimiter — never column-padded. `(CI: lint:md)`
- An ADR uses the section order Context → Decision drivers → Considered options → Decision → Consequences → Rules, and omits rather than pads an empty section.
- An ADR's header carries a one-sentence `Decides` line stating what is true of the platform because of it, and the ADR index carries that line as its *Decides* column. `(CI: lint:adr-xref)`
- A decision driver states a property being optimised for, never the chosen option restated and never a rejected option's worst form. Swapping the winner for a loser must leave the drivers unmet, not wrong.
- An ADR states standing law, never planned work. No `Follow-ups` section, no roadmap, no `TODO`, and no note on whether an artefact exists yet.
- Planned work belongs in the forge's issues, never in a committed document. No committed file links to an untracked one. `(CI: lint:md, lint:prose)`
- ADR numbers are allocated in blocks of a hundred by layer, per [`docs/adr/README.md`](README.md).
- A document's genre decides its directory: `docs/adr/` decisions, `docs/guide/` procedures, `docs/reference/` lookups. The `docs/` root holds the set's entry documents and the registries an ADR names as canonical, and nothing else. `(CI: lint:adr-xref)`
- Topic is carried by the filename, never by a directory holding a single file, and no two documents in `docs/` share a filename. `(CI: lint:adr-xref)`
- Structured logs carry a lowercase message with no trailing punctuation and no symbols; context is OTel-conventioned attributes, never string-interpolated. `(ref: OTel semconv)`
- Human CLI output uses `→` step, `✓` success, `✗` fatal, `⚠` warning, with two-space sub-detail indent. Bare `WARN`/`ERROR` prose and ad-hoc symbols are not used. `(ref: clig.dev)`
- Code comments explain why, not what, in present tense, and cite `ADR-XXXX` when load-bearing.
- Commented-out code, changelog/author/date comments, and decorative banners are not committed.
- A `TODO` cites an issue or an ADR.
- A comment that exists to explain confusing code is a defect; the code is rewritten.
- Template docs are final-state facts: no change-history, no `Supersedes`/`Amends` chains, no `Proposed → Accepted` narrative, a uniform date, and full-rewrite-over-patch. **`(scope: template repo only)`** — a generated project keeps honest ADR history.
- An ADR addresses the engineer maintaining the platform, never a prospective adopter. Selection guidance — who should use this, when not to, what to swap before adopting — lives in the root `README.md`.
- No file under `docs/` links to the root `README.md`, and the ADR set defines every term, test, and table it uses. `(CI: lint:adr-xref)` A generated project rewrites that README, so duplication there is expected and correct.
- A term enters the [ADR-0000](0000-platform-foundations.md) vocabulary only when the ADR set uses it, and only if the repo does not already use that word in another sense.
- A Rule that a task, a policy, or a standard enforces names it: `(CI: <task>)`, `(enforced: <policy>)`, or `(ref: <standard>)`. A Rule with no such mechanism carries no annotation, and is not weaker for it.
