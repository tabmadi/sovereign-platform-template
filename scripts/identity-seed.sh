# Seed the committed deterministic test identities into Kratos (ADR-0601, ADR-0600).
#
# The `edge` profile logs in for real, so it needs a real identity — and it consumes
# the one the e2e suite already defines rather than inventing a development-only
# one. test/e2e/fixtures/identities.ts is the single source of the credentials; this
# reads them with bun (which runs the .ts directly, so no Node and no `e2e:install`)
# and provisions them through the Kratos admin API, exactly as
# test/e2e/fixtures/bootstrap.ts does.
#
# Two deliberate differences from the e2e bootstrap:
#   • idempotent, not reset-per-run — a human's enrolled second factor and live
#     session survive re-running the profile;
#   • no OpenFGA tuple: the `edge` profile runs no OpenFGA and no ops tier, and the
#     coarse ops gate is the `operator` trait, which is set here.
#
# Requires Kratos up. Run by scripts/cluster-edge-profile.sh; safe to run alone.

# The import path above is not a registration: Kratos runs no self-service flow for

# (ADR-0304). A seeded identity would therefore have no personal org, no org_id on
# its Kratos metadata, and no X-Org-Id at the edge — which is not a cosmetic gap,
# because an order belongs to the org its buyer acts through and cannot be placed
# without one. Calling the webhook here is what makes a seeded identity reach the
# same end state a registered one does.
#
# Idempotent twice over: the workflow id is derived from the identity, so Temporal
# rejects a duplicate, and the activities are individually re-runnable.
# Only where orgs is running. The inner-loop floor (cluster:base) is Postgres, the
# edge and identity — no application services — so there is nothing to call there,
# and a seed that insisted would fail the whole tier on a service it never claimed
# to run. On that tier a seeded identity has no org until `cluster:add -- orgs`
# brings one up and this script is re-run; it is idempotent.
