# The sibling cluster:unwedge is REACTIVE — it rescues Argo-synced pods stuck in
# ImagePullBackOff. But cluster:full's imperative head (cilium-install, then the
# ArgoCD install) BLOCKS on `helm --wait` rollouts BEFORE Argo ever runs, so if
# the node's containerd wedges pulling Cilium or ArgoCD through a slow proxy there
# is no pod loop for unwedge to fix — the whole bring-up just hangs. This warms
# every platform image ahead of time: host `docker pull` (the host proxy handles
# large TLS blobs fine) → `kind load docker-image` into the node's containerd.
#
#   mise run cluster:preload          # every platform chart image
#
# Nothing is hardcoded: the image list is derived from the charts via `helm
# template`, so it tracks chart image bumps. The clean-network path never calls
# this — cluster:full only runs it when CLUSTER_PRELOAD=1.

# How an image reaches the node differs by tier, and on the full tier there is no
# load path at all — a Talos node holds nothing the cluster did not PULL.
#
# So the full tier's preload is a push: the image is fetched on the host, where the
# proxy is configured and the pull is serial, then pushed to the local registry.
# The nodes reach it because infra/talos/local/patch.yaml mirrors quay.io, ghcr.io,
# registry.k8s.io and docker.io at that registry, with upstream fallback left on.
#
# The repository path is preserved across the push — `quay.io/argoproj/argocd`
# becomes `registry.localhost:5000/argoproj/argocd` — because a containerd mirror
# requests the SAME path from the mirror endpoint. Rewriting the path would produce
# a registry full of images no node ever asks for.
