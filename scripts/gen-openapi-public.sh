# Emit the developer-portal spec projections the Scalar-rendered portals consume
# (ADR-0008, ADR-0009, ADR-0014). Each projection is ONE merged OpenAPI document,
# not a file per service: the flat /api/<resource> namespace (ADR-0017) hides
# service topology, so the portal is a single unified reference grouped by resource
# tag — no per-service document switcher.
#
# The audience ladder (ADR-0008) is a single per-operation label — cluster →
# internal → public — resolved from the operation's own `x-audience`, else the
# service default (`info.x-audience`), else the fail-closed `cluster`. Projections
# are a threshold on that ladder:
#   - internal.json  audience >= internal (edge surface). The dev portal (behind the
#                    /devportal session gate) renders this — first-party + public ops.
#   - public.json    audience == public only — the anonymous public docs portal's
#                    data (ships with a public API). `cluster` (east-west) ops are in
#                    neither: they bypass the edge and are documented in the READMEs.
#
# Merge is safe because the flat namespace makes paths globally unique and the
# duplicated shared components (Problem, WorkflowHandle, Error) are identical across
# specs, so a deep merge collapses them. `tags` are rebuilt from the operations that
# remain, which prunes tags orphaned by the filtering.
#
# `x-*` specification extensions (incl. the resolved `x-audience`) are projection-time
# inputs only — the renderer never reads them — so they are stripped from the emitted
# specs. That keeps the artifacts lean and avoids editor JSON-schema false-positives
# ("Property is not allowed"). The source specs keep their extensions.
#
# Outputs are generated artifacts: git-committed, Biome-ignored, drift-checked by
# ci:gen. YAML → JSON so the browser renderer needs no YAML parser.
