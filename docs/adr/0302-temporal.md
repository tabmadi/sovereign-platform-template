# ADR-0302: Durable Execution (Temporal)

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-08-06
- **Deciders:** Platform team
- **Related:** [ADR-0000](0000-platform-foundations.md), [ADR-0100](0100-language-and-runtime.md), [ADR-0103](0103-release-and-versioning.md), [ADR-0200](0200-cluster-topology.md), [ADR-0201](0201-gitops.md), [ADR-0205](0205-environment-parity.md), [ADR-0300](0300-data.md), [ADR-0303](0303-api-contracts-and-lifecycle.md), [ADR-0304](0304-identity-and-authorization.md), [ADR-0500](0500-observability.md)
- **Decides:** Temporal is the durable-execution layer and the default async primitive, with five criteria deciding what earns a workflow.

## Context

The platform needs one answer to a family of related problems:

- Operations spanning **multiple services or external systems** that must not leave the system half-applied.
- Operations needing **compensation on failure**.
- **Scheduled and periodic work** — reports, reconciliations, cleanup.
- **Background and async work** — emails, thumbnails, indexing, fan-out.
- **Authz-relevant mutations** ([ADR-0304](0304-identity-and-authorization.md)) writing to both the application database and the authorization datastore, atomically in effect.

Without one durable-execution platform, each grows its own machinery: outbox tables, dead-letter queues, retry loops, cron jobs, custom idempotency. Repeated across a fleet, that is unmaintainable.

## Decision drivers

1. **One reliability primitive, not five.** No coexistence of DLQ, cron, and ad-hoc retries with a workflow engine. One sanctioned lighter path is the single deliberate exception, bounded below.
2. **Service boundaries stay HTTP and OpenAPI.** A workflow engine must not become the cross-service bus.
3. **Adding the second workflow costs much less than the first.** Whatever is adopted must make reliability a library call rather than a design exercise, or the fleet reverts to hand-rolled retries.
4. **A workflow is written in the service's own language**, not in a separate modelling notation maintained beside it.
5. **Operational sovereignty** ([ADR-0000](0000-platform-foundations.md), principle 3).

## Considered options

### The engine

| Option | Workflow is authored as | Added datastores | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Temporal, self-hosted** | ordinary Go, replayed deterministically | none — a database on the existing Postgres cluster | **Chosen.** Activities, child workflows, signals, queries, timers, schedules, and sagas in one model, with first-party SDKs across the mainstream runtimes *(documented)* |
| Restate | ordinary code, similar model | its own embedded log | A simpler operational shape and a genuinely close model. Younger, with a smaller operator population, and the saga and long-timer ergonomics this platform leans on are the newest part of it |
| Cadence | as Temporal, its predecessor | Cassandra or a SQL store | No upside over the project that succeeded it |
| Netflix / Orkes Conductor | **a JSON DAG definition**, with workers in any language | Elasticsearch plus a persistence store | Fails driver 4: the workflow is a document, so the logic lives beside the code rather than in it. The search dependency is also a second datastore |
| Camunda 8 / Zeebe | **BPMN**, authored in a modeller | Elasticsearch or OpenSearch, plus brokers and gateways | The most capable engine here for a process a non-engineer must read, which is not this platform's problem. BPMN is driver 4's exact failure, and the component set is a platform of its own |
| Windmill, Inngest, DBOS | varies — scripts, functions, or a library over Postgres | varies | Lighter, and each answers a narrower slice: scheduled scripts, event-driven functions, or single-database transactions. None covers cross-service sagas with timers, which is the case that motivates this ADR |
| DIY — outbox, queue, cron, retry loops | four mechanisms | none new | Re-implements Temporal poorly, four times, once per service |
| Kubernetes Jobs, CronJobs, Argo Workflows | pipeline DAGs | none new | Not business workflows. Retained for pure infrastructure tasks |
| Temporal Cloud | as Temporal | none | Fails driver 5. Client call sites stay cloud-neutral, so the position is reversible by deploy rather than by rewrite |

## Decision

Self-hosted Temporal is the platform's durable-execution layer and the default async primitive.

### When something is a workflow

A workflow is the right primitive when **any** of these hold:

1. The operation has two or more logical steps where partial completion is a bad state.
2. It touches more than one service or external system.
3. It must compensate on failure rather than return an error.
4. It is long-lived relative to a request.
5. It must survive process restarts by design.

It is the wrong primitive for a single atomic action inside one service.

| Operation | Primitive |
| --- | --- |
| Register user — identity, orgs, authz tuples, welcome email | Workflow |
| Checkout — reserve, charge, order, deduct, confirm | Workflow |
| Payment, often a child workflow of checkout | Workflow |
| Refund — compensation across systems | Workflow |
| Authz-relevant resource mutation | Workflow ([ADR-0304](0304-identity-and-authorization.md)) |
| Daily reconciliation | Workflow on a Temporal `Schedule`, not a `CronJob` |
| Transactional email, fire-and-forget | Outbox, or a workflow if delivery must be tracked |
| Thumbnail or document index | Outbox, or a workflow if part of a larger process |
| Update profile name, add to cart, list orders | Neither — synchronous |

### The outbox seam

A **trivial best-effort** job may use a transactional outbox instead: the triggering row and an `outbox` row commit in one Postgres transaction, and a small per-service dispatcher drains it.

A job stays on the outbox only while **all four** hold. The moment one fails, it is a workflow:

1. one logical step,
2. inside one service, with no cross-service coordination that must not half-apply,
3. best-effort — losing or double-running it is acceptable, so at-least-once dispatch with an idempotent handler suffices,
4. no compensation on failure.

Temporal is the default and the outbox is the sanctioned lighter path for the trivial case. A blanket "all async is a workflow" rule is not adopted: it would forbid the four-condition case above on principle rather than on cost, and the four conditions are narrow enough to police.

### Architecture: co-located workflows, HTTP between services

Workflows, activities, and workers live inside the service that owns the business process.

```text
services/<service>/
├── openapi.yaml
├── cmd/{server,worker}/main.go
├── internal/
│   ├── handlers/        # HTTP handlers from generated server stubs
│   ├── workflows/       # workflows owned by this service
│   ├── activities/      # activities owned by this service
│   ├── domain/
│   └── store/
└── migrations/
```

**Process-owner rule.** A workflow lives in the service owning the *business process*, not the one owning the most data. Register-user lives in identity even though it writes to orgs and the authz store; checkout lives in checkout even though it calls payment, inventory, and orders. A service whose primary job is orchestrating others is a legitimate shape.

**Cross-service invocation is HTTP only:**

1. The owning service exposes an HTTP endpoint that internally starts the workflow.
2. The caller invokes it through the generated client.
3. The response is `202 Accepted` with a handle conforming to the `WorkflowHandle` schema ([ADR-0303](0303-api-contracts-and-lifecycle.md)).

A service never starts another service's workflow through the Temporal client. Doing so imports the callee's workflow input struct and bypasses OpenAPI, tracing, and the identity-header contract.

**Waiting on a cross-service workflow**, chosen by need:

| Mechanism | How |
| --- | --- |
| Poll the handle | the owning service exposes `GET /<resource>/{id}` returning `{status, result?}`; the caller's workflow polls with backoff |
| Webhook callback | the caller passes `callback_url`, the owning service POSTs on completion, and the caller's workflow waits on a signal raised by its own webhook handler |
| Fire-and-forget | the caller does not need the result |

Direct Temporal signals across service boundaries are not used.

### Activity placement

| Scope of use | Location | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| One service's workflows | `services/<service>/internal/activities/` | the common case |
| Generic infrastructure — email, object storage, metrics, webhooks | `libs/go/temporal-activities/<concern>/` | stateless and service-agnostic, with no dependency on `services/` |
| Logically owned by another service | **not shared** — each caller writes a thin activity wrapping the owning service's generated client | the shared thing is the HTTP API |

Sharing an activity across services by putting domain logic in `libs/` couples them behind the API boundary [ADR-0000](0000-platform-foundations.md) principle 10 establishes.

### Wall-clock

A workflow's wall-clock fits inside one production deploy cycle by default. The reason is event-history size and operational legibility, not avoiding versioning, which the next section handles directly.

A longer wall-clock is permitted and requires:

1. an entry in `docs/reference/long-running-workflows.md` with the expected wall-clock,
2. replay tests over historical event histories in CI,
3. a documented `workflow.GetVersion` patching plan, because a workflow outliving a deploy is by definition resumed by code that did not start it.

### Worker Deployment Versioning

The failure mode: a workflow started before a deploy is resumed by a worker running after it, and if the code no longer replays the recorded history the execution dies with a non-determinism error. A short wall-clock shrinks the exposure window without closing it — a thirty-second checkout can still be mid-flight when a worker rolls.

| Option | In-flight work on deploy | Cost per workflow author | Added components | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Worker Deployment Versioning, reconciled by the Temporal Worker Controller | pinned to the version that started it | none in the ordinary case | **one controller with an admission webhook** | The strongest mechanism, and the reliability is bought once at the platform layer. **Deferred**, on the trigger below: it puts a young reconciler in the deploy path of every service to close a window the wall-clock rule already bounds |
| `workflow.GetVersion` patching only | survives, if every divergence is guarded | **a patch branch per change, retained until no history references it** | none | The mechanism versioning replaces. It scales with the number of changes rather than the number of workflows, and a missed guard is a non-determinism error in production |
| Build-ID versioning without the controller | pinned, until the old pods go | none | none | Temporal has the versioning APIs, so this is the same routing behaviour. It fails on the second row below: a rolling `Deployment` deletes the pinned version's pods the moment rollout completes |
| Versioning driven from CI rather than a reconciler | pinned | none | none | Version registration and promotion are one-shot at deploy time, and draining is a state that changes long after the pipeline exits |
| **No versioning; keep workflows short, and patch what can diverge** | exposed for the duration of a workflow | a wall-clock budget per workflow, and a guard on a divergent change | none | **Chosen as the floor.** It shrinks the window rather than closing it — a thirty-second checkout can still be mid-flight when a worker rolls — and that residual is priced against a component every deploy would depend on *(reasoned)* |

**The floor is the honest baseline, and the controller is deferred.** Workers run as plain Deployments. The wall-clock rule already keeps a workflow inside one deploy cycle, so the exposure window is a rollout rather than a workflow lifetime, and a workflow whose change could diverge mid-flight is guarded with `workflow.GetVersion`. That is the last row of the table plus the second, and it buys the reliability the first row buys for the executions this platform runs — without putting a young controller and an admission webhook in the path of every deploy.

Versioning is the better mechanism and it is not free: it is a reconciler on the deploy path, and the row above it in the table is what makes the reconciler unavoidable once versioning is on at all.

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Trigger** | a workflow's wall-clock legitimately exceeds a deploy cycle — the first entry in `docs/reference/long-running-workflows.md` — or a non-determinism failure reaches production twice |
| **Seam** | ✓ the worker is a chart value. Adopting versioning installs the controller and renders `WorkerDeployment` CRs instead of Deployments; workflow code is unchanged, because Pinned executions need no patching |
| **Cost if adopted late** | the `GetVersion` branches written in the meantime stay until no event history references them. Bounded by the wall-clock rule: a history that no longer exists cannot pin a branch |

This is a **deferral, not a bet.** The seam is a chart value and the versioning APIs are the server's, present whether or not anything drives them.

### What adopting versioning brings with it

Four properties are why the controller, not a chart, is what drives versioning when the trigger fires:

| Consequence | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| **The Build ID tracks the code, not the release channel** | The controller derives it from the image tag plus a hash of the pod template, so a configuration-only change is also a new version. Stricter than deriving from the image alone ([ADR-0103](0103-release-and-versioning.md)), which is why the chart does not compute it |
| **A pin is only as good as the pods behind it** | Pinning to a version that can no longer be reached is worse than not pinning: the execution does not fail over, it waits. A rolling `Deployment` deletes the old version's pods the instant rollout completes, so protection would last seconds rather than the workflow's lifetime. Workers are therefore `WorkerDeployment` CRs reconciled by the **Temporal Worker Controller**, which keeps one Deployment per Build ID alive until Temporal reports it Drained. Retaining a version until its work finishes depends on drainage state only Temporal knows, changing long after a sync ends, so it is reconciler work rather than something a chart can template |
| **Promotion belongs to the controller** | It registers each version, promotes per `rollout.strategy`, and injects the deployment and build-ID environment variables itself. Upstream is explicit that those must not be set by hand. Rollback sets the current version to the previous Build ID, whose pods still exist precisely because sunset is delayed |
| **Sessions and versioning are mutually exclusive** | The SDK refuses `EnableSessionWorker` together with versioning, so a service needing sessions opts out explicitly and owes a patching plan instead |

**Deleting a `WorkerDeployment` blocks while its workers still poll.** The CR carries a delete-protection finalizer; on delete the controller asks Temporal to remove each version, and Temporal refuses while pods of that version exist and for a further poller-expiry window after they are gone. The controller retries indefinitely, so the CR sits `Terminating` and Argo cannot recreate it.

Removing a worker therefore means scaling the versioned Deployments to zero first and waiting for pollers to expire. The break-glass is patching the finalizer away, which leaves the Temporal-side version records to age out.

### Draining a worker on rollout

Distinct from replay safety and routinely confused with it: when a worker pod is rolled, **in-flight activities are lost unless the worker is told to wait**. The Go SDK's `WorkerStopTimeout` defaults to no wait, so the platform sets it explicitly, and the chart derives `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` from it so kubelet always waits strictly longer than the worker. Configuring the grace period independently is how this silently regresses.

This is [12-Factor IX](https://12factor.net/disposability) taken past where the factor stops. The factor asks that a process shut down gracefully on `SIGTERM`, and leaves to the platform the question of how long *gracefully* is. For a worker holding an in-flight activity, the answer is the stop timeout, and the grace period follows from it.

### What Temporal replaces

| Legacy pattern | Replacement |
| --- | --- |
| Multi-step or cross-service outbox machinery | Workflows. The database write and the downstream effect are activities in one workflow. The transactional outbox survives only for the trivial best-effort case |
| Event bus (NATS, Kafka) | **Not adopted.** HTTP plus signals via webhook callbacks cover cross-service notification, and the deferral below governs the case they do not |
| Kubernetes `CronJob` for business-meaningful work | Temporal `Schedule`. `CronJob` remains for pure infrastructure |
| Background queues | Workflows on a `background-tq` queue, except trivial best-effort jobs on the outbox seam |

**A publish-subscribe bus is deferred.**

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Trigger** | one event has three or more independent consumers whose identities the producer should not know, or a consumer needs to replay an event stream it was not running for |
| **Seam** | ⚠ **a bet.** Cross-service notification is point-to-point — an HTTP call or a signal naming its target — so adopting a bus rewrites the producers rather than the transport. Nothing here publishes to a topic that a broker could take over |
| **Cost if adopted late** | every producer already names its consumers, so the fan-out has been encoded into N call sites that each have to be found and inverted |

### Operational shape

| Element | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Server | the Temporal monolith binary, all four roles in one process, via Helm, backed by a separate database on the platform Postgres cluster |
| Workers | one deployment per service, registering only that service's workflows and activities, shipping with its service |
| Task queues | named per service, plus a shared `background-tq` |
| Namespaces | one per environment |
| History retention | 30 days production, 7 days non-prod |
| Local | the inner loop uses `temporal server start-dev` for speed; the full tier runs this same chart at one replica, CNPG-backed ([ADR-0600](0600-local-development-loop.md)) |

### Conventions

| Convention | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| Determinism | no `time.Now()`, no `math/rand`, no direct I/O, no goroutines — use `workflow.Go`. Side effects go through activities |
| Idempotency | every activity tolerates being invoked twice with the same input. Run ID plus activity ID is the natural key for external calls |
| Payload size | activity inputs and outputs stay in kilobytes. Large payloads go through the object bucket, and activities pass references |
| Timeouts | explicit. Default activity `StartToCloseTimeout` 30s, default `WorkflowExecutionTimeout` 1h. Overrides carry a justification in the workflow file |
| Errors | typed through `temporal.NewApplicationError` with stable types, and retry policy keys off them |
| Workflow IDs | encode business intent — `payment-{order_id}`, not `payment-{uuid}` — because idempotency is a property of the business operation |
| SDK call sites | only in `internal/workflows/` and `internal/activities/` |

### Cross-cutting integrations

Authz dual-write discipline is [ADR-0304](0304-identity-and-authorization.md)'s, the `WorkflowHandle` shape is [ADR-0303](0303-api-contracts-and-lifecycle.md)'s, service-to-service identity propagation is [ADR-0304](0304-identity-and-authorization.md)'s, and trace propagation is [ADR-0500](0500-observability.md)'s. Nothing here overrides them.

## Consequences

### Positive

- One reliability primitive answers four problems, learned once, with no second runtime to operate.
- Saga compensation becomes routine rather than bespoke.
- Multi-step outbox machinery has no place to live; the outbox survives only as the deliberate lighter path.
- Authz dual-write risk is structurally solved rather than policed.
- Service boundaries remain HTTP and OpenAPI.

### Negative / Risks

- **Non-determinism rules are a real cognitive tax**, and deferring versioning leaves it on the workflow author. Mitigated by `workflowcheck`, a review checklist, and the wall-clock rule, which keeps the set of reachable histories small enough to reason about. Versioning is what removes the reasoning rather than bounding it, and that is what its trigger buys.
- **A rollout during an in-flight execution can still kill it.** The window is a rollout rather than a workflow lifetime, and it is not zero. This is the accepted residual of deferring, and its second occurrence in production is the trigger.
- **The deferral's cost is paid in patch branches**, one per divergent change, retained until no event history references it. The wall-clock rule bounds the retention; nothing bounds the count except how often workflow logic changes.
- **The Temporal server is critical infrastructure.** Mitigated by HA Postgres and replay tests proving workflows tolerate restarts.
- **Per-activity latency in the tens of milliseconds** rules workflows out of sub-100ms request paths. The scope rule already excludes those.
- **One worker deployment per service multiplies pod count.** Accepted; it preserves ownership.

## Rules

- Temporal is the platform's durable-execution mechanism and the default async primitive. No DLQs, ad-hoc retry loops, or cron jobs for business-meaningful periodic work.
- A workflow exists if the operation matches at least one of the five scope criteria. A trivial best-effort job matching none may use the outbox seam.
- Workflows, activities, and the worker for a service live under `services/<service>/`. There is no top-level workflow directory. `(CI: ci:lint)`
- Cross-service workflow invocation is HTTP through the generated client. Direct Temporal-client calls across service boundaries are not used. `(CI: ci:lint)`
- Cross-service result waiting is polling, a webhook callback, or fire-and-forget. Direct cross-service signals are not used.
- Activities are placed by ownership and are never shared across services as a domain wrapper.
- A workflow's wall-clock fits one production deploy cycle. A longer one requires an entry in `docs/reference/long-running-workflows.md` with replay tests.
- Workers run unversioned. Replay safety across a deploy rests on the wall-clock rule and on `workflow.GetVersion` guarding any change a running history could reach.
- A change to a workflow that alters its command sequence is guarded, or the workflow is drained before the change ships. An unguarded divergent change is a non-determinism error in production.
- Worker Deployment Versioning is adopted only on its recorded trigger, and adopting it brings the controller with it: a versioned worker is a `WorkerDeployment` reconciled by the controller, never a plain `Deployment`, and Build IDs and the deployment and build-ID environment variables are then set by the controller alone.
- Sunset delays, where versioning is adopted, are only lengthened, never shortened toward zero.
- Worker graceful-stop is configured, and `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` is derived from the worker stop timeout rather than set independently.
- Workflow code is deterministic and side effects go through activities. `(CI: ci:lint)`
- Activities are idempotent and accept retries.
- Every activity a workflow executes by name is registered on that service's worker. `(CI: lint:activity-register)`
- Workflow IDs encode business intent, not opaque UUIDs.
- Activity inputs and outputs stay in kilobytes; larger payloads go through the bucket by reference.
- Periodic business-meaningful work uses a Temporal `Schedule`. `CronJob` is reserved for pure infrastructure.
- Temporal Cloud is not used.
