# mise TOLERATES a missing `_.file = ".env"` — it does not warn, it just resolves
# no environment. So on a fresh clone `mise run server` used to start with an unset
# DATABASE_URL and die somewhere inside the pgx driver, which tells you nothing
# about the actual problem ("you never copied .env.example").
#
# Seeding alone is not enough either: `_.file` is read when mise LOADS the config,
# before any task runs, so a copy made here cannot be picked up by the run that
# made it. Hence seed-then-stop — the next invocation has a real environment, and
# the message says so rather than leaving you to guess.
