- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-08-06

- **Decides:** Product is served from the apex and operator tooling from one origin per tool under `*.ops.<host>`.

## Context

Every environment exposes two kinds of HTTP surface behind one Traefik edge:

| Surface | Contents | Code ownership |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Product** | the Next.js app, the service APIs, browser telemetry ingest | first-party |
| **Operations tooling** | Hubble UI, Grafana, the Lowdefy console, Argo CD, the Temporal UI, Headlamp, pgweb, the Mailpit viewer, the SeaweedFS admin UI | **third-party — deployed, not authored** |

This ADR fixes where each lives, how one operator login covers the ops tier, and what the API path looks like.

## Decision drivers

1. **Browser-enforced origin isolation between tiers.** A flaw in one origin must not read or script another. The boundary is the same-origin policy, not path discipline.
2. **Logins are paid during an incident.** An investigation crosses several dashboards, so the number of authentications it costs is a property of the layout, not a preference.
3. **Least authority, not least cookie.** A logged-in session grants no ops tool by itself.
4. **Predictable, wildcard-friendly names** ([ADR-0003](0003-naming-and-identifiers.md)).
5. **Parity** ([ADR-0205](0205-environment-parity.md)). The same scheme, host-parameterised, everywhere.

## Considered options

### Where ops tooling lives

| Option | Browser isolation | Per-tool hosting cost | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **A subdomain per tool under a shared `ops.` label** | **each origin is distinct**: cookies, storage, CSP, and rate-limit scope isolated by construction | none — every tool is served at a root | **Chosen** *(reasoned)* |
| Paths on the product origin | **none** — path segments share cookies, `localStorage`, and the DOM, so a flaw in code we do not control executes in the same origin as the product session | a per-tool fight: Hubble UI's router is hardwired to basename `/` and 404s under any prefix, Grafana needs sub-path serving, Argo CD and the Temporal UI have their own quirks | Both problems are disqualifying |
| A flat subdomain per tool, no `ops.` label | per-tool isolation, and see below | none | The only domain covering all of them is the product origin itself, so a shared ops cookie would reach product and re-merge the tiers |
| Paths on the product origin with `__Host-` cookies per tool | **none between tools** — the prefix binds a cookie to the host, not to a path, so every tool still shares one origin | the same per-tool fight | The cheap middle option, and it does not exist: `__Host-` hardens a cookie against subdomain injection and grants no path isolation, because the same-origin policy has no path dimension |
| A separate registrable domain for ops | strongest — no shared parent | none, plus a second certificate authority chain and DNS zone | Warranted only where the parent-scoped cookie is itself the threat. Recorded as the hardening path |

### How ops origins are named

| Option | Survives swapping the tool | Naming decision per tool | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **After the tool, lowercased** — `grafana`, `hubble`, `temporal` | no — the URL moves with the tool | none; the name is already chosen | **Chosen.** One sentence, no judgement calls, and the rename happens only on an event that is already a migration *(reasoned)* |
| After the concept — `o11y`, `map`, `workflows`, `s3` | **claimed, but no** | one debate per tool | The theory is that a concept name outlives the tool. It does not hold: swapping a network-flow UI for an APM suite changes the concept too, and a tool's concept drifts as it grows features. Concept naming produces renames on tool changes *and* naming debates in between. It also lets a hostname stake a territorial claim — one asserting ownership of "observability" frames a complementary second tool as a rival for the name rather than as a different question-answerer |

Two accepted costs: `pgweb.ops` is less self-evident than `db.ops` to a newcomer, and the URL moves when the tool does. The first is answered by the table below naming the concern next to every host; the second would have happened under concept naming anyway.

The objection that tool names leak the stack is real and weak here: the wildcard certificate keeps individual subdomains out of Certificate Transparency logs, every origin is gated on an operator session with a second factor, and the `ops.` label already announces that operator tooling exists.

### Where the service API lives

| Option | CORS | Isolation gained | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **A path on the product origin, `<host>/api/<resource>`** | **none needed** | n/a | **Chosen.** A JSON API has no DOM, JS, or browser storage to isolate, so a separate origin protects nothing it has *(reasoned)* |
| `api.<host>` | manufactured for our own frontend | **none against the cookie** — a `Domain=<host>` cookie reaches `api.<host>` too | The reasons it sounds right evaporate: WAF and rate limits attach per path router already, and the edge already routes `/api/*` to services and `/` to the frontend |
| A separate registrable domain | required | **hard credential isolation** — the app session cookie genuinely cannot reach the API | Warranted only for that guarantee, or for separate edge and CDN infrastructure at scale. Not the default |
| Per-service paths, `/api/<svc>/...` | none needed | n/a | Leaks topology into every URL, so a resource cannot move between services without breaking callers |

## Decision

### Two tiers under one registrable host

`<host>` is the environment host.

| Tier | Origin | Contents |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Product** | `<host>` (apex) | the Next.js app — landing, auth, `panel`, `devportal`; `/api/<resource>/*`; the browser telemetry ingest path |
| **Ops** | `*.ops.<host>` | one origin per operator tool |

The service APIs stay **same-origin** under the flat path, because the browser app is their only first-party client, so same-origin avoids CORS and keeps the session cookie naturally scoped.

### Ops-tier hostnames

The grammar is `{tool}.{tier}.{env-host}`. The product tier carries no tier label.

| Tool | Hostname | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hubble UI | `hubble.ops.<host>` | served at root; its SPA cannot run under a path |
| Grafana | `grafana.ops.<host>` | sub-path serving off |
| Argo CD | `argocd.ops.<host>` | replaces port-forward access |
| Temporal UI | `temporal.ops.<host>` | replaces port-forward access |
| Lowdefy admin | `lowdefy.ops.<host>` | the sole admin surface ([ADR-0401](0401-internal-admin.md)) |
| Headlamp | `headlamp.ops.<host>` | read-only by default ([ADR-0501](0501-operator-uis-and-dashboards.md)) |
| pgweb | `pgweb.ops.<host>` | read-only break-glass |
| Mailpit | `mailpit.ops.<host>` | **non-prod only** — the mail sink's viewer ([ADR-0307](0307-outbound-email.md)) |
| SeaweedFS admin | `seaweedfs.ops.<host>` | **non-prod only**, and the sole exposed surface of that component |

**A component exposing several UIs gets one origin, not several.** SeaweedFS ships a master UI, a filer UI, and an admin UI; only the admin UI is routed. The others are diagnostic surfaces reached the way any unrouted surface is reached, because an origin per internal view multiplies CSP, rate-limit, and session surface for no operator capability that the admin UI lacks. The production instance runs outside the cluster ([ADR-0200](0200-cluster-topology.md)), so it has no `ops.<host>` origin at all and its administration is not an edge concern.

### Why the `ops.` label is load-bearing

Cookies are sent to a domain and its **descendants** only, never to siblings or to a parent's other children.

- Flat ops hostnames would have `<host>` — **the product origin** — as their only common parent, so any cookie shared across ops tools would also reach product.
- Nesting under `ops.<host>` lets an ops cookie be scoped to that label: it covers every tool and **not** the apex.

The `ops.` segment is the mechanism that makes "one operator login, isolated from product" expressible on a single registrable host.

### Cookie and session model

**Default: one parent-scoped session cookie**, shared across the apex and every ops origin. This is accepted because every origin under `<host>` is first-party and edge-gated: **tier isolation is enforced by per-tool authorization and by requiring a second factor on the ops tier, not by cookie scope.** A compromised non-operator product session reaching an ops origin is still denied by the dashboard gate.

**The property deliberately traded away is token-level isolation.** The session token is sent across the whole subtree, so an XSS on the high-surface product origin could ride an *operator's* session into the ops tools. The product-origin CSP ([ADR-0400](0400-frontend.md)) is the compensating control.

**This is the highest-severity accepted risk in the set, and it is recorded as one.** The impact is every ops tool an operator can reach, which is the cluster's control surface; the likelihood is whatever the product origin's XSS posture is; and the compensating control is a header, not a boundary. It carries its severity in [`docs/reference/risk-register.md`](../reference/risk-register.md) rather than only in this list, because a risk of this size read once in a Consequences section is a risk nobody re-reads.

**Isolating the token too is a deferred hardening.** Keep the product cookie host-only on the apex and have the ops tier mint its own scoped session via OIDC behind one ops-tier auth proxy — per tier, not per tool. One Kratos instance cannot issue two differently-scoped cookies, and the apex cannot set a cookie on the sibling subtree, so OIDC is the mechanism.

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Trigger** | any non-first-party origin is hosted under `<host>`, or the product surface renders content one user supplies to another. The first makes the shared cookie unsound by construction; the second raises the XSS likelihood the CSP is holding alone |
| **Seam** | ✓ every ops route already passes one forward-auth middleware ([ADR-0305](0305-edge-auth-and-traffic-policy.md)), so the change is what that middleware validates. No tool is reconfigured, and no URL moves |
| **Cost if adopted late** | the shared parent-scoped cookie has already been readable by the newly added origin for as long as it has been hosted, and no later scoping retracts a token that has already been sent |

### Authorization is split by who owns the code

| Surface | Enforcement point |
| --- | --- |
| Product — our code | the app or service decides, through `Checker` ([ADR-0304](0304-identity-and-authorization.md)). The edge only authenticates, and page-level access is a `Checker` call in the render layer, not a bare session check |
| Ops dashboards — third-party | the edge decides, because the tool cannot run a permission check itself |

The ops gate's two layers, and why the coarse one deliberately makes no authz call, are [ADR-0304](0304-identity-and-authorization.md)'s. The consequence for this ADR: losing the authz plane degrades the ops tier to "any operator reaches any tool", never "nobody reaches anything".

### Certificates, DNS, and routing

- Two wildcard certificates per environment: one for the apex's siblings, which also covers `ops.<host>` itself, and one for the ops tools, which sit two labels deep. Both issued by cert-manager.
- Both wildcards resolve to the edge.
- Product routes match on host. Ops routes are one host-matched IngressRoute per tool behind the ops forward-auth middleware, host-parameterised so every environment shares the manifests.

### Content placement: the SEO axis against the trust axis

Two independent axes decide where a surface lives, and conflating them is the mistake this rule prevents.

- **Discoverability favours an apex subdirectory.** Google states it handles subdomains and subdirectories equivalently for ranking, so this is not a ranking claim: a subdirectory keeps one host, one certificate, and one analytics property, and it is same-origin with `/api`, which is what makes a "try it" console work without CORS.
- **Trust isolation favours a separate origin**, and that is a browser guarantee rather than a preference.

They conflict only for anonymous content, and one rule resolves it: **the first axis applies only to surfaces that are both anonymous and indexable. Anything behind a login is `noindex` and is placed on trust grounds alone.**

| Surface | Placement | Deciding axis |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Product docs, blog, guides, changelog | apex subdirectory | anonymous and indexable |
| Public API reference — `public` operations only | apex subdirectory | anonymous and indexable; first-party and read-only |
| Dev portal — audience `>= internal` | apex subdirectory | behind the session and `Checker`; same-origin with `/api`, so "try it" needs no CORS |
| Partner credential dashboard | its own subdomain, separate auth realm | behind login, so `noindex`; a non-Kratos realm must not share the apex session cookie |

**The external third tier is deferred.** An internal-only project has exactly the product and ops tiers, and the rows above describe where the third one lands when it exists.

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Trigger** | a party outside the organisation is issued credentials against the API |
| **Seam** | ✓ the tier is a third host under the same wildcard and the same edge, and its auth realm is a second Oathkeeper rule set rather than a change to the first ([ADR-0305](0305-edge-auth-and-traffic-policy.md)). Nothing in the product or ops tiers moves |
| **Cost if adopted late** | partner credentials have already been issued through whatever surface existed, usually the product origin, so the separation begins by migrating live credentials and the sessions holding them |

### The API path

The service API is a **flat resource namespace** — the URL names the resource, not the service that owns it. This is the Stripe and GitHub facade: a caller sees one coherent surface, and which service serves a route is an internal detail that can change without breaking a URL.

**Collision governance.** One flat namespace means two services cannot both own a resource prefix. That is a feature — a name collision is a genuine domain-modelling conflict — and it is enforced by CI rather than left to chance. The edge route table is the ownership registry ([ADR-0305](0305-edge-auth-and-traffic-policy.md)).

**East-west endpoints are not on this surface.** They bypass the edge, are gated by NetworkPolicy, and appear in neither docs portal.

**One reserved path sits outside both tiers.** `/.well-known/` on the apex is neither product nor ops surface; it is where the web's own conventions live, so nothing else claims that prefix. The apex publishes [`security.txt`](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9116) there — a contact address and a disclosure policy — because a researcher who finds something looks in exactly one place, and its absence routes the report to whatever public inbox they can find instead.

**The path holds for a public or partner API too.** It is distinguished by its `x-audience: public` contract and its JWT auth, not by its origin. Versioning never enters the URL: the default is single-live-version, and online versioning rides a header ([ADR-0303](0303-api-contracts-and-lifecycle.md)), which is precisely why the flat resource URL stays stable across versions.

## Single sign-on for the operator consoles

Self-hosting multiplies consoles — Forgejo, zot, Grafana, Argo CD, Headlamp, Hubble,
the Temporal UI, pgweb — and the cost lands on offboarding: someone leaves, and
the question is whether anyone remembers all eight.

**The answer is the identity stack already here, not a ninth component.** Ory Hydra
is already in the tree as the OIDC provider ([ADR-0305](0305-edge-auth-and-traffic-policy.md)),
Kratos is already the identity source, and the login UI already exists at
`/auth/login`. Consoles that speak OIDC consume it; deactivating one Kratos identity
removes access to all of them at once.

| Option | Verdict |
| --- | --- |
| **Hydra + Kratos, already deployed** | **Chosen.** No new component, no second identity source, and one offboarding action. Consent is auto-granted for first-party console clients, which is what keeps a third-party consent screen from appearing in front of an internal tool *(reasoned)* |
| Authentik | The best admin experience in the field and the wrong shape here: it is a second identity system beside Kratos, so every person exists twice and offboarding becomes two actions — the problem restated, not solved. It also brings its own PostgreSQL and Redis |
| Zitadel | Live candidate for this slot precisely because the objections to it are about custom login UIs and config-as-code for *application* identity, neither of which applies to hosted-login OIDC. It still loses on the same count as Authentik: a second source of people |
| Keycloak | The same duplication, on a JVM, with realms and mappers to learn |
| Authelia | A tiny footprint and a forward-auth model this platform already has, in Oathkeeper. It would replace a component rather than add SSO |

**Consoles that do not speak OIDC stay edge-gated**, which is what they have today:
Oathkeeper's forward-auth in front of `{tool}.ops.<host>` already requires a Kratos
session, so access is single sign-on even where the console has no idea. pgweb, the
Hubble UI and the Temporal UI are in this group.

**The residual risk is local accounts, and it is the one worth naming.** Grafana,
Forgejo and Argo CD each keep an internal admin that bypasses OIDC entirely, so an
offboarding that only deactivates the Kratos identity leaves those standing. Each
console's local admin is therefore a **break-glass credential in the secret store**
([ADR-0202](0202-secrets.md)) rather than a per-person account — one credential to
rotate, and nobody's personal login.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Each tier is a separate origin, so an ops dashboard cannot read or script the product app, and a product-side XSS cannot script an ops tool. Browser-enforced, not conventional.
- Each ops tool is isolated from the others too: per-origin CSP, headers, rate limits, and storage.
- Tools that resist path hosting are each served at a clean root, with no base-path fights.
- A logged-in session does not imply tool access.
- Argo CD, Temporal, and the SeaweedFS admin UI get auth-gated URLs instead of port-forwarding.

### Negative / Risks

- **A second wildcard certificate and deeper DNS.** cert-manager handles it, and it is more moving parts.
- **No token-level tier isolation in the default model.** Accepted while every origin is first-party, with per-tool authorization, operator MFA, and the product CSP as compensating controls, and the OIDC upgrade as the closer.
- **Subdomain-takeover hygiene matters more.** Dangling ops DNS must not be left claimable.
- **The ops tier depends on one edge auth path.** Its failure locks operators out of every dashboard at once, which is why break-glass is a written procedure ([`docs/guide/break-glass.md`](../guide/break-glass.md)) rather than improvisation.

## Rules

- Surfaces belong to exactly one tier: product on the apex, ops tooling on `*.ops.<host>`. No operator dashboard is served from a product path, and no product surface from an `ops.` subdomain.
- A project shipping a public API adds a deferred external tier: public docs on an apex subdirectory and the partner credential dashboard on its own subdomain.
- Anonymous, indexable, first-party content is served from an apex subdirectory. A subdomain is used only for a distinct trust boundary, never merely because a surface is public.
- The public API docs portal is anonymous; only credential management is authenticated.
- The service API is a flat resource namespace at `<host>/api/<resource>`, never per-service. `(CI: lint:service-contract)`
- `/.well-known/` on the apex is reserved for web conventions and claimed by no product route. The apex serves `security.txt` with a contact address and a disclosure policy. `(ref: RFC 9116, RFC 8615)`
- The path holds for the public API too. A distinct origin is used only for hard credential isolation — which needs a separate registrable domain, since a parent-scoped cookie reaches a subdomain — or separate edge infrastructure at scale.
- Ops-tier hostnames are `{tool}.ops.<host>`, named after the **upstream project**, lowercase, matching the naming charset ([ADR-0003](0003-naming-and-identifiers.md)). Not the concept it serves, not its binary, and not an abbreviation of either.
- The default is one session cookie scoped to the parent host, with tier isolation enforced by per-tool authorization and an AAL2 requirement on the ops tier. This is permitted only while every origin under `<host>` is first-party and edge-gated.
- Splitting the cookie is the optional token-isolation upgrade and is mandatory if any non-first-party origin is hosted under `<host>`.
- Each environment provisions both wildcard certificates.
- A bare authenticated session never grants ops-tool access.
