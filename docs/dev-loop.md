# The local development loop (ADR-0600)

Two tiers, and a service is native or in-cluster within either. This is which one to pick, how to be logged in, and what each tier deliberately cannot tell you.

## Pick a tier

| You are | Run | Cost |
| --- | --- | --- |
| writing service code | `mise run cluster:up`, then the service's own task | seconds to start, no image build |
| working on the UI | `cluster:up` + `mise run mock:start` | same, plus a mock serving the committed contract |
| changing charts, sync waves, or anything Argo delivers | `mise run cluster:up -- full` | minutes; it is the whole platform |
| about to open a PR | `mise run cluster:up -- full`, then `mise run e2e` | the configuration CI runs |

`cluster:up` is the floor: Cilium, Traefik, cert-manager, a stand-in Postgres, Kratos and Oathkeeper, plus the seeded test identities. It is unconditional and it is cheap. Everything else is opt-in and **declared by the service that needs it** — there are no profiles to pick from, and no table to keep honest.

```sh
mise run cluster:up                 # the floor
mise run -C services/orders server    # brings up dep:postgres, dep:openfga, dep:temporal first
mise run -C services/orders worker    # …and svc:catalog, svc:payment, which the saga calls
```

Those `depends` lists are checked against the code by `lint:service-deps`, so a dependency the code has and the list does not is a CI failure rather than a confusing one at run time.

## Native or in-cluster

| Mode | Command | Use it when | It cannot |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **native** | `mise run service:dev -- <svc>`, then `mise run -C services/<svc> server` | you want a debugger, or a change every second | see the pod's env or files, and NetworkPolicy does not apply to it |
| **in-cluster** | `mise run cluster:add -- <svc>` | you need the real pod: its env, its mounts, its policy | attach a debugger, and it costs an image build per change |

Both sit behind the real edge. Native mode stamps an IngressRoute and an EndpointSlice pointing at the host, so Traefik routes to your process and it receives **real Oathkeeper identity headers** — the same ones the pod would get.

Any number of services can be native at once. Each binds its own registered port from `scripts/lib/ports.sh`; `:8080` is unassigned because the host maps it to the edge. Debugging a flow across three services is three native services with breakpoints in all three, and everything they call still in the cluster.

`cluster:add` pauses that app's Argo auto-sync so the working-tree image is not reverted. `mise run cluster:remove -- <svc>` puts it back — leaving it paused means the cluster has silently stopped tracking `master`.

## Be logged in

There is no bypass, and adding one is a review-blocker (`lint:auth-inline`). Both tiers run the real Kratos, and both seed the committed test identities on bring-up:

| Identity | Credentials | Is | Gets you |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| admin | `admin@localtest.me` / `1st Password!` | AAL2 (password + TOTP) | the ops hosts — the day-to-day full-tier account |
| operator | `operator@e2e.localtest.me` / `0perator-e2e-Sessi0n!` | AAL2 (password + TOTP) | the same ops hosts — the e2e fixture, recreated per suite run |
| user | `user@e2e.localtest.me` / `Pr0duct-e2e-Sessi0n!` | AAL1 (password) | the product surface |

`admin` is created once and left alone; `operator` and `user` are recreated on every e2e run for determinism, so do not build a workflow around their session. Log in at `https://dev.localtest.me:8443/auth/login`; the ops hosts are `https://<name>.ops.dev.localtest.me:8443` and answer `401` until you do.

The second factor is enrolled at run time rather than imported, because Kratos cannot import a TOTP credential. First login with an operator account takes you to the settings flow once to enrol it. `mise run auth:seed` re-runs the whole provisioning if a login stops working.

## HTTP proxies

Proxy handling is decoupled from every cluster command: `mise run cluster:up` is the same command on a direct network and a firewalled one. Behind a proxy, run `mise run proxy:setup` once first. It converges what the cluster commands then assume — the docker daemon's own proxy, which is how the local zot reaches upstream registries on behalf of every node (ADR-0105), the build container's, and `NO_PROXY` covering `.localtest.me`, `localhost` and `127.0.0.1`, without which every local request is sent to a proxy that cannot resolve it and the symptom is a timeout rather than a refusal.

Images are not affected by any of this beyond step 1. `cluster:up` fills the local registry before it creates the cluster, and the nodes pull only from there — so if a pull is going to fail for want of egress, it fails while warming, naming the image, rather than as an `ImagePullBackOff` twenty minutes later. The full setup, including what to put in the Docker daemon's environment, is [guide/http-proxy.md](guide/http-proxy.md).

## After a reboot

The inner loop routes to natively-run services through an EndpointSlice pointing at the docker-bridge gateway — the only host address a pod can reach. It is stamped at bring-up and is wrong after the bridge is recreated, which a reboot does: the cluster comes back, the pods are Ready, and every native route 502s. `mise run cluster:heal` re-starts the node (clearing a half-restored Cilium datapath) and re-stamps the edge glue. It is idempotent; run it whenever the cluster survived something the host did.

## UI work: the mock

```sh
mise run mock:start     # Prism, serving apps/frontend/public/devportal/openapi/internal.json
mise run mock:logs      # the interesting half: unmatched routes, and bodies that fail the spec
mise run mock:stop
```

The mock takes over `/api` at a priority no service route can reach, so it works whether or not any service is running. It sits **behind the real edge** and the real middleware chain, so the request path — TLS, identity-header stripping, forward-auth, security headers — is the production one.

What it will not do, by design:

- **serve identity.** No `401`, no session awareness, no identity headers. Auth behaviour comes from Kratos and Oathkeeper, which are already in the floor.
- **have state.** Two POSTs return the same thing; nothing persists, nothing progresses. A workflow's `status` stays at whatever the example says.
- **be a test fixture.** It is forbidden in `test`, `ci:affected`, and the e2e and visual suites — a suite that passes against a mock has asserted the mock.

Its only input is the committed projection, so a response you disagree with is fixed in `services/<svc>/openapi.yaml` and regenerated. That is the point: the fidelity is bought in the contract, where the whole team gets it.

## What each tier cannot tell you

**`cluster:up` cannot tell you:**

- whether it works on the real datastores. Its Postgres is a plain ephemeral image, not CNPG: no pooler, no failover, no backups, and the database is empty again on every restart. Its Temporal and OpenFGA stand-ins are the same trade.
- whether the delivery works. Nothing here reconciles from git, so sync waves, ApplicationSet generators and secret materialisation are all untested.
- whether a native service obeys its NetworkPolicy. The host process is not in the mesh, so nothing enforces one against it.

**`cluster:up full` cannot tell you:**

- whether your uncommitted change works, unless you put it there. Argo reconciles committed `master`, not your working tree — use `cluster:add`, `platform:deploy`, or a branch `targetRevision` ([guide/gitops-local.md](guide/gitops-local.md)).
- whether it survives scale. Everything runs at one replica through the `local` values overlay, so a bug that needs two of something will not appear.

**Neither tells you about node count or the multi-node failure modes**, and neither is a performance measurement: everything shares one machine's CPU with your compiler. Load testing is `mise run perf` against the full tier, and even that is a relative number.

## When it breaks

| Symptom | Try |
| --- | --- |
| a pod stuck pulling | `mise run cluster:up` — it re-warms the registry, then converges |
| native routing dead (502 at /) after a reboot — the bridge IP changed | `mise run cluster:heal` |
| everything is odd and you want the time back | `mise run cluster:down`, then bring the tier up again |
| the edge answers 404 for a service you deployed | check Argo did not revert it: `kubectl -n argocd get app` |

Disk is the usual culprit for a full tier that half-works: the node evicts pods and garbage-collects images it cannot re-pull, because the inner loop's images exist only on the node. `docker system prune` and a rebuild, in that order.

## Where the rules are

[ADR-0600](adr/0600-local-development-loop.md) is the decision and its consequences; this page is how to use it. [guide/gitops-local.md](guide/gitops-local.md) covers testing uncommitted infrastructure, and [guide/first-change.md](guide/first-change.md) is the end-to-end walk through adding something.
