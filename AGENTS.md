# Agent guide

Tool-agnostic guide for any coding agent (Codex, Cursor, Claude Code, or another) working in this repo. `AGENTS.md` is the one standard: an agent either reads it or it does not — the repo carries no per-tool shim files (`CLAUDE.md`, `.cursor/rules/`, etc.). A tool that ignores `AGENTS.md` is a limitation of that tool, not something the repo works around.

## The one rule that outranks this file

**Humans are the first developers. ADRs and `docs/` outrank this file.** The canonical home for any decision, convention, or rationale is an [ADR](docs/adr) or a `docs/` file — human-first, tool-neutral, reviewed.

This file holds only agent-specific operational hints: how to navigate, build, and run the repo, and what to read first. Everything else is a link into the ADRs and docs.

- A line a new human developer would also need belongs in an ADR or a doc. This file links it.
- A line one tool needs belongs in that tool's own dotfile, not here.

## Read first

- [ADR-0000](docs/adr/0000-platform-foundations.md) — the thesis, principles, vocabulary, and ADR process. Read it before anything else.
- [docs/adr/README.md](docs/adr/README.md) — the block map and the full ADR index, one line each.
- The [ADR index](docs/adr) — every load-bearing decision. Each ADR ends with a flat **Rules** section, and each carries a one-sentence **Decides** line in its header. Reading the index's *Decides* column is the fastest complete pass over the set.
- [docs/reference/rules-index.md](docs/reference/rules-index.md) — every rule in the set with its enforcement, generated from those Rules sections. One grep covers the whole law.
- [docs/reference/system-view.md](docs/reference/system-view.md) — what runs and how a request moves, on one page.

## Load these first, by task

The set is large and each task class needs a small part of it. Grep the Rules sections named here before reading any ADR body; a rule's rationale is a separate question from what the rule is.

| Changing | Load | Then check |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A service's behaviour | [0303](docs/adr/0303-api-contracts-and-lifecycle.md) contracts, [0300](docs/adr/0300-data.md) data, [0304](docs/adr/0304-identity-and-authorization.md) authorization, [0500](docs/adr/0500-observability.md) instrumentation | `mise run lint:service-contract`, `lint:authz` |
| An API spec | [0303](docs/adr/0303-api-contracts-and-lifecycle.md), [0003](docs/adr/0003-naming-and-identifiers.md) identifiers | `mise run gen` then `lint:openapi`, `lint:api-audience` |
| A workflow | [0302](docs/adr/0302-temporal.md), and `docs/reference/long-running-workflows.md` if the wall-clock is long | replay tests |
| A chart or values file | [0201](docs/adr/0201-gitops.md), [0204](docs/adr/0204-resource-management.md), [0205](docs/adr/0205-environment-parity.md) | `mise run lint:resource-governance`, `lint:floating-tags` |
| Anything at the edge or about identity | [0305](docs/adr/0305-edge-auth-and-traffic-policy.md), [0306](docs/adr/0306-trust-tiers-and-urls.md), [0304](docs/adr/0304-identity-and-authorization.md) | `mise run lint:auth-inline`, and [docs/reference/threat-model.md](docs/reference/threat-model.md) |
| Frontend code | [0400](docs/adr/0400-frontend.md), [0306](docs/adr/0306-trust-tiers-and-urls.md), [0700](docs/adr/0700-analytics.md) for anything emitting events | `mise run lint:ts` |
| A document or an ADR | [0001](docs/adr/0001-documentation-and-output-conventions.md), and `_template.md` for a new ADR | `mise run lint:prose`, `lint:adr-xref`, `lint:md` |
| A rule's wording | the owning ADR only — the rules index and the security baseline are generated | `mise run gen` then `lint:rules-index` |

## How the docs are organised

- **`Rules`** at the bottom of each ADR are normative and greppable. A rule that a mechanism enforces names it: `(CI: <task>)` = a linter or workflow, `(enforced: <policy>)` = admission control, `(ref: <standard>)` = an adopted external standard. An unannotated rule is equally normative, and has no gate to point at. Treat a `(CI: …)` rule as a hard invariant. To check a convention, grep the Rules sections first; read the full ADR only when you need the rationale behind a rule.
- **House style** for prose, logging, CLI output, and code comments is [ADR-0001](docs/adr/0001-documentation-and-output-conventions.md). It adopts ISO 24495-1 plain language, Google developer-docs voice, OTel semantic conventions for logs, and clig.dev for CLI output, and makes only the deltas normative. Its **banned-constructs table** governs every doc and every comment you write: no chronology, no intensifiers, no hedges, no meta-commentary. Every word is load-bearing, and three or more items sharing two or more attributes are a table.
- **Genre decides the path** ([ADR-0001](docs/adr/0001-documentation-and-output-conventions.md)): `docs/adr/` decisions, `docs/guide/` procedures, `docs/reference/` lookups and registries. The `docs/` root holds the entry documents and the registries an ADR names as canonical. Everything is indexed in [docs/README.md](docs/README.md). A doc holds a procedure or live state; a decision lives only in its ADR.
- **An ADR is law, not a plan.** It states what is true of this platform, never what someone intends to do about it. Do not add a `Follow-ups` section, a roadmap, a `TODO`, or a remark that something is `not yet wired` — a gap between an ADR and the repo is unfinished work, not an unfinished decision, and the rule binds regardless ([ADR-0001](docs/adr/0001-documentation-and-output-conventions.md)).
- **Planned work goes in a local `*.local.md` file**, which `.gitignore` excludes and nothing committed links to. `PLAN.local.md` is this repo's, and it is where you record any gap you find between a decision and the code. It may be absent — that is normal, since it is per-engineer and untracked. Never create a committed roadmap, backlog, or status file to replace it: a tracked plan is inherited by every generated project, which then carries a backlog belonging to someone else. A `*.local.md` file and its content are private to the engineer who wrote them: never cite, quote, or reference them in a commit, a doc, a PR description, or any other output. If content from one is worth keeping, restate it fresh in the ADR or doc where it belongs.
- **Audience.** The ADR set is inherited wholesale by every project generated from this repo, so write an ADR for the engineer maintaining the platform, not for someone deciding whether to adopt it. Never write "this template targets…" or "when not to use this" in an ADR — that is selection guidance and belongs in the root `README.md`. Nothing under `docs/` links to that file, because a generated project rewrites it ([ADR-0001](docs/adr/0001-documentation-and-output-conventions.md)).
- **Component tiers and the operational budget** are [docs/operational-surface.md](docs/operational-surface.md) (Core / Scale / Opt-in). It is also the **only** place platform components are counted.
- **Before writing a number, ask whether doubling it would change the decision.** If yes it is a threshold or a sizing measurement — state it, with the conditions it was taken under. If no it is decoration that goes stale: write the shape ("the platform dominates the footprint") not the figure, and never count live state that lives elsewhere — "the four observability components", "ten workflows in `.github/workflows/`", "~25 components". Link to the registry instead ([ADR-0001](docs/adr/0001-documentation-and-output-conventions.md)).

## Working in the repo

- The task runner is `mise` (root `.mise.toml`); commands are `mise run <task>`. `mise run cluster:up` / `cluster:up full` bring up the local cluster ([ADR-0600](docs/adr/0600-local-development-loop.md)).
- Tools are pinned and installed by `mise`; a shell with mise inactive resolves a bare tool call (`kubectl`, `helm`, `go`, `bun`, …) from `PATH` — usually the home folder, at an unpinned version. Activate mise (`mise activate`, or its shims) before calling a pinned tool by name; `mise run <task>` activates the toolchain for that task's duration, a bare tool call does not.
- Generated code is committed and drift-checked in CI ([ADR-0000](docs/adr/0000-platform-foundations.md), [ADR-0303](docs/adr/0303-api-contracts-and-lifecycle.md)); regenerate with `mise run gen`, do not hand-edit generated files.
- ArgoCD reconciles the cluster from `master`; a working-tree change is invisible in-cluster until pushed ([ADR-0201](docs/adr/0201-gitops.md)). To test uncommitted work on the full tier, pause Argo CD first with `mise run argo:pause` and resume it with `mise run argo:resume` when done — while paused the cluster silently stops tracking `master`, so never leave it paused.
- Before finishing a change, run `mise run check` (or `mise run pre-commit`) to lint, test, and format; `mise run test` / `lint` / `format` run each individually.
