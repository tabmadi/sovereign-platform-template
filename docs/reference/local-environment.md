# Local environment reference

Lookup tables for the local cluster: ports, URLs, and the environment contract. How to *use* them is [dev-loop](../dev-loop.md); the decisions behind them are [ADR-0600](../adr/0600-local-development-loop.md) and [ADR-0306](../adr/0306-trust-tiers-and-urls.md).

## Service ports on the host

Assigned in `scripts/lib/ports.sh` and set as `PORT` in each service's `.mise.toml`. `lint:ports` enforces that the two agree and that no two services collide.

| Service | Host port |
| --- | --- |
| catalog | 8081 |
| orders | 8082 |
| orgs | 8083 |
| payment | 8084 |
| authz | 8085 |

`:8080` is unassigned, because the host maps it to the edge. In-cluster this changes nothing: pods still bind `:8080`.

Override for a single run with `PORT=` in that service's `.env`, which wins over the registry. Prefer editing the registry so callers' `<SVC>_URL` defaults stay correct.

## Forwarded dependencies

`mise run dev:forward` exposes the in-cluster dependencies to the host process and to tools like `psql`.

| Dependency | Host address |
| --- | --- |
| Postgres | `localhost:5432` |
| Temporal gRPC | `localhost:7233` |
| Temporal UI | `localhost:8233` |
| OpenFGA | `localhost:18080` |

OpenFGA is forwarded to `18080` rather than its own `8080` because the host maps `8080` to the edge. `OPENFGA_API_URL` in every `.env.example` points at `18080` to match.

## Product URLs

Everything is served from one origin, `https://dev.localtest.me:8443`. The hostname is real public DNS resolving to `127.0.0.1`, with a locally-issued wildcard certificate. The edge matches longest-prefix, so the specific routes win over the `/` catch-all.

Deployed environments terminate on `443` and omit the port.

| Path | Serves | Auth | Defined in |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `/` | landing page, from the host dev server | public | `infra/local/edge-auth.yaml` |
| `/panel`, `/devportal` | authenticated frontend areas | session | `apps/frontend/src/proxy.ts` |
| `/auth/login`, `/auth/registration`, … | Kratos UI pages, from the host dev server | public | `infra/local/edge-auth.yaml` |
| `/auth/self-service`, `/auth/.well-known`, `/auth/sessions` | Kratos public API | public | `infra/local/edge-auth.yaml` |
| `/api/<resource>` | service APIs, flat namespace ([ADR-0306](../adr/0306-trust-tiers-and-urls.md)) | Oathkeeper | `infra/helm/service/templates/ingressroute.yaml` |
| `/api/rum` | browser-telemetry ingest | public | `infra/gateway/frontend-observability.yaml` |

## Ops URLs

One origin per tool under `*.ops.<host>`, never a product path. Every route is defined in `infra/gateway/ingressroutes.yaml`; an opt-in tool's route resolves to a backend only once its chart is enabled.

The **Auth** column is the always-on coarse gate: the `operator` claim plus an AAL2 session, with no authz call ([ADR-0304](../adr/0304-identity-and-authorization.md)). The optional per-tool `dashboard:<tool>#view` layer is off by default.

| URL | Tool | Extra login |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `grafana.ops.dev.localtest.me:8443` | Grafana — metrics, logs, traces, RUM, policy drops | none |
| `hubble.ops.dev.localtest.me:8443` | Hubble UI — live service map, flows, drop verdicts | none |
| `temporal.ops.dev.localtest.me:8443` | Temporal Web UI | none |
| `argocd.ops.dev.localtest.me:8443` | Argo CD | none |
| `lowdefy.ops.dev.localtest.me:8443` | Lowdefy admin console | none |
| `headlamp.ops.dev.localtest.me:8443` | Headlamp — Kubernetes debug UI, read-only | none |
| `pgweb.ops.dev.localtest.me:8443` | pgweb — read-only database inspector | none |
| `mailpit.ops.dev.localtest.me:8443` | Mailpit — the mail sink's viewer, non-prod only | none |
| `seaweedfs.ops.dev.localtest.me:8443` | SeaweedFS admin UI, non-prod only | none |
| `zot.ops.dev.localtest.me:8443` | zot console — the registry catalogue, tags, and what the mirror has cached | none |

Every tool above trusts the edge and serves anonymously, so an operator who clears the gate lands straight on it. **The zot console cannot serve anonymously** — its access policy is one configuration for one process, and opening it would open `registry.dev.localtest.me:8443` to anonymous pulls with it ([ADR-0105](../adr/0105-image-registry.md)). So the credential is presented for the browser instead: a small reverse proxy in the zot pod adds the registry's `cluster` pull user on the `zot.ops` origin alone, and the operator meets no second prompt. The `registry.<host>` origin still asks for that credential; read it with `kubectl -n platform get secret zot-credentials -o jsonpath='{.data.htpasswd}' | base64 -d` — the local bundle's password is the committed throwaway one.

**Two zots run locally, and they answer different questions.** `zot.ops` above is the platform's own registry — in-cluster, backed by the object store, the component a deployed environment runs. The one the **nodes pull from** is the host container at `http://registry.localhost:5000`, which mirrors the upstream registries and holds the repo's own images; it serves its console at that address with no login, so "is this image cached yet" is a page rather than a `curl`. The split is not redundancy: a `*.localtest.me` name does not resolve inside a node, so the in-cluster registry cannot be the node pull source locally ([ADR-0105](../adr/0105-image-registry.md)) — the host container is. The in-cluster instance is deployed anyway so its chart is exercised on the full tier, and `cluster:up full` mirrors the first-party images into it after bring-up, so its `zot.ops` catalogue shows the same images CI would push in a deployed environment rather than sitting empty. If you opened `zot.ops` and it was empty, the mirror step had not run yet; `mise run cluster:populate-zot` fills it.

**Why that one is not on `localtest.me`.** Every origin in the table above is reached by a browser on the host, where `*.localtest.me` resolves to `127.0.0.1` and the edge answers. The registry is reached by a **node's containerd**, and inside a node container `127.0.0.1` is the node itself — so a `localtest.me` name would send every image pull to the wrong place. `registry.localhost` is the registry container's own name, which docker's embedded DNS resolves to its address from any container on the network. It also cannot go through the edge: Traefik's own image has to be pulled before Traefik can route anything.

SeaweedFS's master and filer UIs are not routed either ([ADR-0306](../adr/0306-trust-tiers-and-urls.md)); reach them by port-forward.

Mailpit holds every message the Kratos courier submits, so it is where a verification or recovery mail is read; production keeps no such store ([ADR-0307](../adr/0307-outbound-email.md)).

Without the edge, Grafana is still reachable by `kubectl -n platform port-forward svc/grafana 3000:80`. Mailpit likewise by `kubectl -n platform port-forward svc/mailpit 8025:8025`.

## Frontend environment contract

`mise run dev:frontend` sets these. Starting the dev server another way — an IDE run configuration, a debugger — needs the same values: copy `apps/frontend/.env.example` to `.env.local`, which Next loads before evaluating its config.

| Variable | Why it exists |
| --- | --- |
| `EDGE_PUBLIC_ORIGIN` | The **browser's** edge origin, so it carries the port. The server-action CSRF allowlist is derived from it. Server components fall back to it when the internal origin is unset, which is correct on the host where the two are the same. Unset, the first server-side fetch throws |
| `EDGE_INTERNAL_ORIGIN` | Where **this process** dials the edge. In-cluster that is the edge's `:443`, not the browser's `:8443` — one variable cannot be both, which is why there are two. Set only in-cluster |
| `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED` | Local only. See the note below |

Browser-side calls need none of this: the client uses a relative `/api`, which is same-origin by construction. A server-side fetch has no document to resolve a relative URL against, so the origin is named once — and it must be configuration rather than the request's `Host` header, because that header is client-controlled and this fetcher forwards the user's session cookie.

`NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED` exists only while the local issuer mints a self-signed **leaf**. Under the local **CA** ([ADR-0600](../adr/0600-local-development-loop.md)) the certificate is trusted properly and the variable is not set; deployed environments never set either TLS variable.
