# Auth single-source lint. Two rules, one subject: authentication is defined in
# exactly one place and enforced by the real stack.
#
#  1. The auth CONFIG lives exactly once, in the canonical infra/auth tree, and is
#     injected into the Ory umbrella chart at install time (Helm `-f` overlays +
#     `--set-file`; ArgoCD valueFiles + fileParameters). This guard fails CI if any
#     of it is re-inlined back into the chart values, which is how the copies
#     silently diverged before.
#  2. The frontend carries no development-only auth CODE (ADR-0600). Local work
#     against mocked data still logs in for real via the `edge` profile, so a
#     session bypass, a synthetic session object, or a NODE_ENV branch in the app's
#     auth path has no reason to exist — and principle 9 predicts what happens to
#     one that does.

# --- 2. No development-only auth code in the frontend (ADR-0600) -------------
# Scope is the WHOLE application, not just its authn gate and auth library. Those
# two are where a bypass belongs if it exists at all, which is exactly why nobody
# puts one there: it goes in a server action, a fetcher, or a layout, where it
# reads like a convenience. The rule says the application carries no
# development-only authentication code, so the linter reads the application.
#
# Widening is safe because the patterns below are narrow — they name a bypass
# outright, or pair NODE_ENV with an auth word on the same line. Comments are
# dropped so this file's own prose, and the ADR pointers in the app, do not trip it.
