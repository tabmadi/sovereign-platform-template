# (CRD→operator→instance ordering, secret materialisation, sync waves) is ArgoCD's
# job, the same tool prod runs; this script only does what Argo cannot bootstrap:
# create the cluster, install the CNI + Argo itself, plant the SOPS decryption key,
# apply the local root-app, then wait and wire the host-specific edge tail.
#
# Baseline (choice a): Argo syncs committed master from GitHub — CI-built images,
# identical to prod. To iterate on uncommitted code/infra, see service:deploy /
# platform:deploy, or point the local root-app targetRevision at a pushed branch.
#
# Teardown: mise run cluster:stop (stop) / mise run cluster:delete (delete).

# push works only if the name resolves into those CIDRs — which depends on each dev's
# NSS setup mapping *.localhost to loopback (e.g. myhostname). Where it doesn't,
# k3d-registry.localhost resolves elsewhere and docker demands TLS: "server gave HTTP
# response to HTTPS client". 127.0.0.1 sidesteps all of that (loopback is insecure on
# every daemon, no per-machine daemon.json). Both names address the same registry
# container and blobs are keyed by repo path, so REG stays the cluster-facing pull
# name in the values overlays; only the push target differs.
