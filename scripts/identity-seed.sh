# Seed the committed deterministic test identities into Kratos (ADR-0601, ADR-0600).
#
# The `edge` profile logs in for real, so it needs a real identity — and it consumes
# the one the e2e suite already defines rather than inventing a development-only
# one. test/e2e/fixtures/identities.ts is the single source of the credentials; this
# reads them with bun (which runs the .ts directly, so no Node and no `e2e:install`)
# and provisions them through the Kratos admin API, exactly as
# test/e2e/fixtures/bootstrap.ts does.
#
# Two deliberate differences from the e2e bootstrap:
#   • idempotent, not reset-per-run — a human's enrolled second factor and live
#     session survive re-running the profile;
#   • no OpenFGA tuple: the `edge` profile runs no OpenFGA and no ops tier, and the
#     coarse ops gate is the `operator` trait, which is set here.
#
# Requires Kratos up. Run by scripts/cluster-edge-profile.sh; safe to run alone.
