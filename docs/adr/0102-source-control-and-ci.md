# ADR-0102: Source Control & CI Platform

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-08-06
- **Deciders:** Platform team
- **Related:** [ADR-0000](0000-platform-foundations.md), [ADR-0101](0101-monorepo.md), [ADR-0103](0103-release-and-versioning.md), [ADR-0104](0104-supply-chain-security.md)
- **Decides:** Forgejo is the forge and Forgejo Actions the pipeline runner, entered through `mise run ci:*` so the forge stays cheap to leave.

## Context

[ADR-0000](0000-platform-foundations.md) principle 3 makes source control and CI a first-class decision rather than a signup. A forge bundles four concerns a managed provider hides: the repository, the review record, the pipeline, and the identity that signs artefacts.

The pipeline is where artefacts are built and signed ([ADR-0104](0104-supply-chain-security.md)), so whoever runs it decides what "built by us" can be proven against.

A managed forge is the one dependency that cannot be reconciled with principle 3 by pinning or by a contract, because the trust root is the thing being outsourced.

## Decision drivers

1. **Operational sovereignty** ([ADR-0000](0000-platform-foundations.md), principle 3). Source, review, and build run on infrastructure the organisation controls.
2. **Thinnest viable platform** (principle 2). A forge is one component. A suite that arrives with its own datastore fleet is a different purchase.
3. **Exit cost stays low** (principle 4). Whatever is chosen, the pipeline definition must not become where build logic lives, because then leaving means rewriting it rather than re-pointing it.
4. **One primitive per concern** (principle 5). Source, review, and pipelines are one purchase or several, and each additional system is operational surface the platform team carries.
5. **The build environment is part of the supply chain** ([ADR-0104](0104-supply-chain-security.md)). Whoever runs the pipeline can alter what is built, whatever is signed afterwards.

## Considered options

| Option | Component weight | Pipelines | Governance | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Forgejo + Forgejo Actions** | one Go binary, plus a Postgres on the forge host | built in, GitHub-Actions workflow syntax, runners are self-hosted by definition | non-profit umbrella ([Codeberg e.V.](https://forgejo.org/)), [GPLv3+](https://lwn.net/Articles/986998/) | **Chosen.** The only option that satisfies drivers 1–4 together *(reasoned)* |
| Gitea + Gitea Actions | identical | identical | company-controlled | Functionally equivalent. Provenance is *recorded evidence about exit cost* (principle 4), and the governing body is the only discriminator between two otherwise equal choices |
| Gogs | one Go binary | **none** — no built-in CI | maintainer-led | The ancestor both rows above forked from, and the pipelines went with the forks. Adopting it lands on the separate-CI-engine row below |
| GitLab CE | a suite — Gitaly, Redis, Sidekiq, its own Postgres, several web services | mature and complete | company-controlled, open-core | Rejected by principle 2, as [ADR-0000](0000-platform-foundations.md) already records. It replaces one component with a platform |
| Self-hosted forge + separate CI engine | two components | Woodpecker, Tekton, or Argo Workflows | varies | Rejected by principle 5, as [ADR-0000](0000-platform-foundations.md) already records: a second system beside the forge |
| A managed forge — the do-nothing baseline | none | hosted runners | third-party | Fails driver 1 outright. It leaves axis B asserted rather than held, and the identity that signs artefacts in a third party's control |

Forgejo and Gitea are the same software lineage and score identically on every technical row. Principle 4 says provenance does not veto a choice but is recorded; here it is the only distinguishing evidence, so it decides.

### The two tools the pipeline runs on

Both Tier 2 ([ADR-0002](0002-tool-adoption.md)), and both are consequences of the runner shape rather than independent preferences.

| Concern | Chosen | Picked over | Why |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Image builds | **BuildKit, rootless** | Buildah, Kaniko, a socket-mounted Docker daemon | The node is immutable and exposes no Docker socket ([ADR-0200](0200-cluster-topology.md)), so a socket-mounted builder is unavailable rather than rejected *(reasoned)*. Of the three that remain, BuildKit is the one the `Dockerfile` syntax is defined against, so cache mounts and multi-stage behaviour need no translation. Buildah is the runner-up and its exit is a task change |
| Running a workflow locally | **act** | pushing to a branch, running a self-hosted runner on the workstation | Workflow YAML is a thin caller of `mise run ci:*`, so most local verification is running the task directly. `act` covers the remaining case — the workflow wiring itself — without a push |

## Decision

| Concern | Decision |
| --- | --- |
| Forge | **Forgejo**, self-hosted on its own host, with its Postgres on that same host |
| Pipelines | **Forgejo Actions**, with runners on infrastructure we control |
| Workflow content | checkout, toolchain setup, then `mise run ci:*`. Logic does not live in YAML |
| Review record | pull requests on the forge. Branch protection and required checks are configuration in the repository ([ADR-0000](0000-platform-foundations.md), principle 1) |
| Registry | **not** the forge's package registry. [ADR-0105](0105-image-registry.md) decides it separately |

**Workflow YAML is a portable subset.** Steps are `actions/checkout`, the repository's own composite setup action, and `mise run` calls. That subset runs on both Forgejo Actions and the provider-hosted workflows the template ships, which is what makes the forge cheap to leave in either direction.

### The template ships provider-hosted workflows

A generated project needs CI from its first commit, before any cluster exists to run a forge on. The workflows under `.github/workflows/` are therefore the bootstrap path, not a competing decision.

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Trigger** | the platform cluster serves its first environment |
| **Seam** | ✓ the thin-YAML rule above. Moving is a re-targeting of the same `mise run ci:*` calls, not a rewrite of pipeline logic |
| **Cost if adopted late** | the pipeline migration is flat — the thin-YAML rule makes it a re-target rather than a rewrite. **The review record is not flat.** Pull requests, review comments, and issues are forge-native and do not travel with a `git push`, so that body grows for as long as the decision waits. Sovereignty is also asserted rather than held until it lands |

### Signing identity

[ADR-0104](0104-supply-chain-security.md) signs with a key pair held in SOPS rather than against a third-party certificate authority, precisely so the signing identity does not depend on which forge runs the pipeline. Moving the forge re-targets the workflow and leaves the trust root untouched.

Forgejo does mint [per-job OIDC tokens for Actions](https://forgejo.org/docs/latest/user/actions/security-openid-connect/), alongside ephemeral runners. That capability is available for anything wanting a short-lived workload identity; it is not what signs images.

## Where the forge runs

**Outside the workload cluster**, on its own host, and this is the same decision
[ADR-0207](0207-cluster-storage.md) makes about the production object store for the
same reason: a component that exists to recover a cluster must not share that
cluster's failure domain.

The forcing argument is circularity. Argo CD reconciles the platform from git, git
lives in the forge, and the forge would be deployed by Argo — so a full-cluster loss
leaves nothing to reconcile *from*. Recovery would start by rebuilding the forge by
hand, from a backup, before any of the automation that depends on it can run. That
is not a recovery procedure anyone should discover during an incident.

Running it outside removes the cycle rather than sequencing it: Argo syncs from a
forge that Argo never deployed.

**Its database goes with it.** A forge on its own host whose Postgres is the
workload cluster's CNPG has moved the binary and left the state behind: the same
cluster loss still takes the repositories, the pull requests and the review record
with it, and the recovery still starts by restoring a database from a backup before
anything can reconcile. The forge host carries its own Postgres for the same reason
it is a host at all.

| | In the workload cluster | Outside it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Recovery from full-cluster loss | rebuild the forge first, by hand, from a backup | the source is already there; Argo reconciles |
| Bootstrap order | forge must be installed imperatively before Argo, like Argo itself | no ordering constraint at all |
| Operational cost | one fewer host | one more host, patched and backed up separately |
| Blast radius of a cluster mistake | takes the source of truth with it | does not |

The cost is honest and it is a host: someone patches it, backs it up, and monitors
it outside the platform's own observability. That is the price of the property, and
it is the same price already paid for the object store.

**zot is the same question with a different answer.** The registry is on the
critical path for every pod start, so an in-cluster registry cannot serve the
cluster it lives in during a cold start — but unlike the forge it holds no source of
truth: it is object-storage-backed and its contents are rebuildable by a redeploy
([ADR-0105](0105-image-registry.md)). What it needs is for its BUCKET to be outside
the cluster, which [ADR-0207](0207-cluster-storage.md) already requires in
production. The registry itself stays in-cluster.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Source, review, pipelines, and the build identity run on controlled infrastructure. Axis B is held rather than asserted.
- Forgejo Actions reuses the workflow syntax already in the repository, so the migration is re-targeting rather than rewriting.
- No second CI engine, and the forge's database is a single Postgres on the forge host — the one place it can be without re-entering the cluster's failure domain.

### Negative / Risks

- **The forge joins Core**, and a forge outage blocks merges and builds. Argo CD keeps reconciling from the last synced commit, so a forge outage does not stop the running system.
- **Self-hosted runners are compute the platform team owns**, including their cache and their isolation. Untrusted-PR execution is a policy question a public repository must answer before enabling it.
- **Forgejo's pipeline feature set trails the provider it imitates.** The thin-YAML rule bounds the exposure: the surface used is checkout, setup, and a task call.

## Rules

- The forge is Forgejo, self-hosted on a host outside the workload cluster, with its Postgres on that host.
- **The forge runs OUTSIDE the workload cluster it serves.** See below.
- Pipelines run on Forgejo Actions with runners on controlled infrastructure. No second CI engine is introduced ([ADR-0000](0000-platform-foundations.md), principle 5).
- Workflow YAML checks out, sets up the toolchain, and calls `mise run ci:*`. Pipeline logic is not written in YAML.
- Branch protection and required checks are configuration in the repository, never set through the forge UI ([ADR-0000](0000-platform-foundations.md), principle 1).
- Container images are published to the registry in [ADR-0105](0105-image-registry.md), not to the forge's package registry.
