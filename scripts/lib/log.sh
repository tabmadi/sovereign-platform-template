#   source "$(dirname "$0")/lib/log.sh"
# Then: step "doing X"; ok "done"; warn "heads up"; fail "fatal" (fail exits 1).

# This is formatting only — it swallows no errors and hides no failures, so it is
# compatible with the "explicit scripts, no magic" rule. The four symbols are the
# fixed vocabulary; nothing here alters control flow except `fail`, which exits.
