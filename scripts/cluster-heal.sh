# Heal a local k3d cluster after a host reboot (ADR-0003).
#
# Docker's restart policy on the k3d node is `unless-stopped`, so on daemon start
# (after a reboot) Docker replays the node container RAW — without k3d's own start
# orchestration. That skips the step where k3d injects the `host.k3d.internal`
# alias + CoreDNS records, so on a proxied machine the node's proxy target becomes
# unresolvable: containerd can't pull the pause/CNI images, Cilium never comes up,
# and every pod hangs in ContainerCreating cluster-wide. `k3d cluster stop && start`
# is the fix — the start path re-injects the alias — so this wraps that as a
# one-liner. Idempotent and safe to run anytime the cluster looks wedged after a
# reboot. See docs/dev-loop.md ("After a reboot").
