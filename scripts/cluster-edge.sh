# Host-only edge glue: routes the product apex (https://dev.localtest.me:8443) to a
# natively-run frontend (`next dev` on :3000) and the Kratos public API (ADR-0009/
# 0010/0014). Deliberately NOT GitOps-managed — prod deploys the frontend in-cluster,
# and infra/gateway is what ArgoCD syncs. This is per-machine state that must be
# re-applied on every cluster START, not just at cluster:full time, for two reasons:
#   • the catch-all `frontend` IngressRoute is not persisted by Argo, so a stop/start
#     or reboot loses it → Traefik answers `404 page not found` at `/`;
#   • the frontend-dev EndpointSlice points at the docker-bridge gateway IP (the only
#     host address a pod can reach), which can change across a k3d restart → a stale
#     address gives a 502. Re-reading it every run self-heals both.
# Idempotent; safe to run any time the cluster is up. Called by cluster-ensure.sh
# (start path), cluster-heal.sh (reboot recovery), and cluster-full.sh (bring-up).
