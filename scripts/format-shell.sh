# Shell formatter (ADR-0101). All glue in this repo is bash, so scripts get the
# same formatting Go/TS do: shfmt over every shell script, in place. `-i 2` matches
# the repo's 2-space style.
#
# A script rather than a one-line mise task, so it shares its file enumeration with
# `lint:shell` (scripts/lib/repo-files.sh). The two disagreeing is how a repository
# ends up formatted but unlinted.
