# prod platform secrets

This directory is synced by the `prod-secrets` Application (the `secrets` ApplicationSet, [ADR-0201](../../../../../docs/adr/0201-gitops.md), sync-wave 1). The base-tier sops-operator reconciles the `SopsSecret` CR here into native Kubernetes Secrets that the data + core platform tiers consume ([ADR-0202](../../../../../docs/adr/0202-secrets.md)).

**The template ships this README, not the secret.** A template repo cannot carry real cluster secrets, and the `prod` cluster key in `.sops.yaml` is a placeholder. Until you add `platform.enc.yaml` below, the Application syncs to zero resources (Healthy, empty) and the platform charts that reference these Secrets stay in `CreateContainerConfigError`.

## Adopt

1. Generate the `prod` cluster age key and replace the `cluster_prod` placeholder in `.sops.yaml` with its public half; plant the private half in-cluster (see `docs/guide/secrets-runbook.md` and `infra/talos/README.md` — on Talos it rides in the SOPS-encrypted machine config as an inline manifest, because there is no host filesystem to place it on).
2. **Replace the other two recipients of that path as well.** `.sops.yaml` gives it `eng_placeholder` and `ops_recovery` beside the cluster key, and sops encrypts to every recipient of a rule or to none — one remaining placeholder fails the encrypt with `malformed recipient`, naming the placeholder rather than the rule that pulled it in.
3. Copy the skeleton below to `platform.enc.yaml`, fill in real values, and encrypt it in place: `sops --encrypt --in-place infra/gitops/platform/prod/secrets/platform.enc.yaml`. The `.sops.yaml` rule for this path encrypts only `data`/`stringData` values (the CR structure stays readable) to `cluster_prod` + engineers + ops-recovery.
4. Commit. Argo delivers it and the operator materialises the Secrets.
