// Package buildinfo exposes the identity of the running binary (ADR-0013): the
// git SHA it was built from, the release version, and the build time. It lets
// "what is actually deployed" be answered from the artifact itself, not inferred
// from an image tag or a ConfigMap — which is the whole point, since those can
// drift from the binary they claim to describe.
//
// Values are injected at build time via -ldflags -X (see the service Dockerfiles).
// When unset — e.g. `go run` or a `go build` without ldflags — they fall back to
// the Go VCS stamp from debug.ReadBuildInfo so local runs still self-report.
