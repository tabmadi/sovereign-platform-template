# Ensure the single local k3d cluster exists and is running (ADR-0003, ADR-0016).
# Convergent: create it if absent, start it if stopped (cluster:stop keeps the
# image cache + volumes; cluster:delete deletes it). One cluster serves both local
# tiers; what differs is what you bring up on it:
#   mise run cluster:lite     → inner loop (lightweight deps, run services natively)
#   mise run cluster:full   → full platform via ArgoCD
#
# Flannel + the built-in network policy are disabled because Cilium is the CNI
# (NetworkPolicy + Hubble, ADR-0003). Traefik stays (it provides the IngressRoute/
# Middleware CRDs the edge uses). Ports 8080/8443 map the loadbalancer.
#
# Proxy-free unless YOUR shell is proxied — no proxy value lives in the repo. The
# node's containerd needs the proxy at create time (it inherits nothing else); the
# create block below reads it from your exported HTTP(S)_PROXY and injects it, so a
# clean shell makes a pristine cluster. See docs/dev-loop.md ("HTTP proxies").
#
# Local image registry (ADR-0016 parity): repo-built images (services, lowdefy) have
# no CI/ghcr locally, so Argo has nothing to pull. k3d-registry.localhost:5000 is the
# local stand-in for CI — cluster:full builds+pushes to it, the local values overlays
# point at it, and Argo pulls exactly as prod pulls from ghcr. Wired via --registry-use
# at create time, so an existing cluster must be recreated once to gain it.

  # registry-qps/burst=0 (unlimited) disables kubelet's per-registry image-pull
  # rate limiter. Its default (5 qps / 10 burst) exists to spare PUBLIC registries;
  # against our OWN local registry it just throttles cold/mass reschedules into a
  # "pull QPS exceeded" storm that adds minutes of backoff. Create-time only.
  #
  # eviction-hard pinned at 2% free (both filesystems): a developer disk often sits
  # near-full, and kubelet's stock disk-pressure threshold (taints ~10-15% free)
  # then evicts the WHOLE platform over a few spare GB. Pinning it low keeps pods
  # put until the disk is genuinely almost-full — and pins it so a recreate (or a
  # distro whose default differs from k3s') can't silently raise it. Explicit set,
  # so inode-based eviction is intentionally out of scope here.
  #
  # image-gc-high/low-threshold (98/80% imagefs used) makes kubelet reclaim unused
  # images only once the image filesystem is 98% full, down to 80%. A developer disk
  # here often shares one near-full partition with the k3d node's imagefs, so a lower
  # high-water mark just makes kubelet log perpetual ImageGCFailed/FreeDiskSpaceFailed
  # warnings — it keeps trying to shed layers that are all in-use, freeing nothing.
  # Pinning high at 98 (level with the eviction floor) silences that noise on a busy
  # disk; GC still fires as a last resort right before eviction would.
