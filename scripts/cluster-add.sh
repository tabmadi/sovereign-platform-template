# One verb for "put this in the cluster" (ADR-0600), over the two kinds of thing
# you can add to `cluster:base`:
#
#   mise run cluster:add -- orders     # a service      → scripts/service-deploy.sh
#   mise run cluster:add -- frontend   # an app         → scripts/service-deploy.sh
#   mise run cluster:add -- ory        # a platform chart → scripts/platform-deploy.sh
#
# ── Why a dispatcher and not one merged script ────────────────────────────────
# The two paths share only a spine (pause Argo, then `helm upgrade
# --take-ownership` with the local values). Everything else genuinely differs: the
# argument selects a values file for a service but a chart directory for the
# platform; services always build and import an image, charts never do (except
# lowdefy); charts need the auth overlays and per-chart special cases that mirror
# the ApplicationSet, services need none of it. Merging the bodies would produce
# two scripts in a trenchcoat, so this unifies the interface and leaves the
# implementations where the knowledge lives. Both stay runnable under their own
# names — `platform:deploy` especially, because it prints the "re-enable GitOps"
# instructions you must act on.
#
# ── Why dependency components are not nouns here ──────────────────────────────
# `postgres` is BOTH a platform chart (infra/helm/platform/postgres) and a slice of
# infra/local/deps.yaml. Making dependency components addable by name would make
# `cluster:add -- postgres` ambiguous on day one. They are graph-internal instead:
# services declare `dep:*` in their own .mise.toml and mise resolves them. So this
# dispatcher only ever sees two namespaces, and the ambiguity cannot arise.
