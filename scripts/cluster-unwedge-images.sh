# Unwedge image pulls stalled by an HTTP proxy (OPT-IN, proxied networks only).
#
# The normal bring-up is proxy-free: on a clean network every image pulls fine and
# you never need this. Behind a corporate proxy, though, the k3d node's containerd
# pulls public-registry images (cilium, argocd, openfga/openfga, …) THROUGH privoxy,
# which times out on large TLS blobs and can wedge the pull indefinitely — pods sit
# in ImagePullBackOff / ErrImagePull. See docs/dev-loop.md ("HTTP proxies").
#
# This does the documented manual recovery, automatically and only for what is
# actually stuck: host `docker pull` (the host proxy handles blobs fine) → then
# `k3d image import` into the node's containerd → then delete the stuck pod so it
# retries against the now-local image. Nothing is hardcoded, so it tracks chart
# image bumps and covers whatever the proxy happened to choke on this run.
#
#   mise run cluster:unwedge          # one pass
#   watch -n15 mise run cluster:unwedge   # or loop while a fresh cluster:full converges
#
# The repo's default path never calls this — it exists solely so a proxied machine
# has a working, explicit escape hatch without polluting the clean-network setup.
