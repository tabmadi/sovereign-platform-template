# Generate the third-party image allow-list (ADR-0104).
#
#   mise run gen:image-allowlist
#
# ADR-0104 requires third-party images to be pinned by digest and ALLOW-LISTED. The
# list is the hard half: it is every image every upstream chart pulls, it changes on
# every chart bump, and a hand-maintained one is a list that is wrong the first time
# nobody notices a new sidecar.
#
# So it is derived from the charts themselves. Every platform chart is rendered the
# way ArgoCD renders it, every `image:` in the output is collected, and the
# REPOSITORIES (not the tags) become the list. A repository rather than a full
# reference because the digest is pinned separately, by lint:floating-tags on the
# values a human edits and by Kyverno on the pod spec a chart rendered — this list
# answers a different question: may this image be here at all.
#
# The output is a values fragment, reviewed as a diff. A new entry appearing in a
# chart bump is the review: someone has to look at a registry this platform has
# never pulled from before and say yes.

# 2. Any `image` or `imageName` key anywhere in the document. This is the half that
#    catches an image reaching a pod through a CUSTOM RESOURCE rather than through a
#    pod spec — CNPG's `Cluster.spec.imageName` is the one that taught this: the
#    allow-list was generated without it, Kyverno rejected the operator's own
#    Postgres pod, and the failure surfaced as a PVC stuck WaitForFirstConsumer with
#    nothing in the operator's log. An operator that builds pods from a CR is exactly
#    the case a workload-only walk cannot see.
#
# The charset filter is what makes (2) safe: a chart that ships CRDs ships the
# Kubernetes API schema, where `image` is a field DESCRIPTION. "Container image
# name." is not a reference and does not survive the grep.
