# ADR-0305: Edge Authentication & Traffic Policy

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-08-06
- **Deciders:** Platform team
- **Related:** [ADR-0000](0000-platform-foundations.md), [ADR-0101](0101-monorepo.md), [ADR-0200](0200-cluster-topology.md), [ADR-0303](0303-api-contracts-and-lifecycle.md), [ADR-0304](0304-identity-and-authorization.md), [ADR-0306](0306-trust-tiers-and-urls.md), [ADR-0400](0400-frontend.md)
- **Decides:** Traefik fronting Ory Oathkeeper validates identity once at the edge and injects the headers every service downstream trusts.

## Context

Traefik is the cluster ingress ([ADR-0200](0200-cluster-topology.md)), handling TLS, routing, load balancing, and static assets. This ADR covers what happens **after Traefik and before a service**: who validates the caller's identity, how that identity is carried onward, and what traffic policy applies at the edge.

Service-to-service calls bypass the edge entirely and are gated by Cilium NetworkPolicy, not by a token.

| The edge owns | The edge does not own |
| --- | --- |
| Identity validation — the Kratos session or Hydra JWT, once | Cluster ingress and TLS — Traefik's |
| Identity propagation as trusted headers, in one shape for every request | Permission decisions — services', through `Checker` ([ADR-0304](0304-identity-and-authorization.md)) |
| Rate limiting on auth-sensitive endpoints | Request-schema validation — services', through ogen ([ADR-0303](0303-api-contracts-and-lifecycle.md)) |
| Static browser-security headers and the CSRF Origin check | The per-request CSP nonce — the frontend's ([ADR-0400](0400-frontend.md)) |

## Decision drivers

1. **One identity shape for every request.** A handler reads identity the same way whether the call came from a browser or another service. No "JWT here, headers there".
2. **Services are auth-free in their handlers.** Identity arrives pre-validated.
3. **The edge reads the credential the identity provider issues**, with no translation layer standing between them. [ADR-0304](0304-identity-and-authorization.md) settles what that credential is.
4. **The edge adds no state.** Whatever sits here is on the path of every request, so a datastore behind it is a datastore in front of everything.
5. **Authorization lives in one place.** A policy language at the edge is a second place a permission decision can be written.

## Considered options

### The ingress controller

Traefik is Tier 1 ([ADR-0002](0002-tool-adoption.md)): every inbound request crosses it, the forward-auth chain is expressed in its middleware model, and the routes are CRDs the GitOps tree owns. Compared on the two properties that decide this position — how routing is authored, and whether the forward-auth seam is first-class.

| Option | Routing authored as | Forward-auth | Data plane | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Traefik** | `IngressRoute` CRDs, with middleware as separate composable resources | **first-class middleware**, and the chained shape the next table needs | its own, in Go | **Chosen.** Middleware is a resource rather than an annotation, so a route's auth chain is readable as a list of objects instead of a string *(reasoned)* |
| Envoy Gateway | Gateway API resources, with policy attachment | through `ext_authz`, which is Envoy's native and more expressive mechanism | Envoy | **The runner-up**, and the better data plane. It loses on weight: Envoy plus a control plane is two components where Traefik is one, and `ext_authz` buys expressiveness this platform spends at the application layer instead |
| ingress-nginx | `Ingress` with annotations, plus snippets | `auth-url` annotations | nginx | The most widely deployed, and the annotation model puts routing logic in strings that nothing validates until reload. Configuration-snippet injection has been the recurring class of issue |
| HAProxy Ingress | `Ingress` with annotations, or a ConfigMap | `auth-url` | HAProxy | The strongest data plane on raw throughput, at a configuration surface authored outside the resource model |
| Contour | `HTTPProxy` CRDs, or Gateway API | `ext_authz`, delegated to Envoy | Envoy | Envoy Gateway's shape with a longer lineage and a narrower feature set. It is the option Envoy Gateway supersedes |
| Gateway API on any implementation, no controller chosen | portable resources | implementation-defined | varies | Portability is real and the forward-auth chain is not portable, so the property being bought does not cover the property that decides the row |

**Throughput is not the deciding axis here and is recorded so.** Every option in this table saturates the network before it saturates itself at this platform's shape, so the row that decides it is how a reviewer reads an auth chain in a diff.

### Certificate lifecycle

TLS terminates at the ingress above, so what issues and renews the certificate is decided here.

| Option | Renewal | Configuration | Added components | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **[cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/)** | a controller reconciles `Certificate` resources and renews before expiry | CRDs in the repository | one controller | **Chosen.** The certificate is a Kubernetes object, so a renewal failure is a resource condition an alert already reads rather than a log line in a cron job *(reasoned)* |
| certbot in a `CronJob` | the schedule, and whatever it writes | a shell script and a mounted secret | one Job and a script to own | Renewal failure is silent until TLS breaks, which is the slowest-arriving failure on the floor. Nothing about it is cheaper |
| A private CA | issued by us, on our own schedule | ours | a CA to run, plus trust-anchor distribution to every client | The exit if the public ACME dependency becomes unacceptable ([ADR-0000](0000-platform-foundations.md)), and it costs a trust anchor on every browser and every client |
| Manual issuance | a person, annually | none | none | The honest baseline, and it fails on the wildcard-per-environment shape: an expiry that is a person's calendar entry is an expiry |

One wildcard certificate per environment, issued over ACME DNS-01. The record shape and the provider requirement it implies are [ADR-0206](0206-cluster-networking.md).

### The forward-auth mechanism

| Option | Added components | Reads a Kratos browser session | Identity passed onward as | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Ory Oathkeeper as ForwardAuth** | **none beyond one Go binary**, no datastore | **yes**, and Hydra JWTs through the same rule set | mutated trusted headers, one shape for every route | **Chosen.** Declarative YAML access rules in git, and the only option that reads both credential formats this platform issues without a hop in between *(reasoned)* |
| Plain Traefik `ForwardAuth` to Kratos `/sessions/whoami` | **none at all** | yes | nothing — `whoami` authenticates but does not mutate the request | The zero-component baseline, and the row that prices the chosen one. Without mutation every service must strip client-supplied identity headers itself, and there is no rule language to mark a route public |
| oauth2-proxy | one | **no — it speaks OIDC**, and Kratos issues browser sessions rather than OIDC tokens | OIDC claims as headers | The reflexive answer to this problem, and it needs Hydra in front of Kratos before it has anything to validate. That adds an OAuth2 round trip to first-party browser traffic to satisfy a proxy rather than a requirement |
| Authelia | one, plus a session store | no — it carries its own identity model | headers | An identity provider with a forward-auth front-end. Adopting it re-decides [ADR-0304](0304-identity-and-authorization.md) rather than serving it |
| Pomerium | one, plus its own state | no — OIDC | headers, with per-route policy | The strongest alternative on expressiveness. Same OIDC mismatch, and its policy language is a second home for authorization, against driver 5 |
| Envoy `ext_authz` | Envoy at the edge, beside or instead of Traefik | through a service we write | whatever that service sets | A mechanism rather than a product: it re-poses the question as *what runs behind it*, and swapping the ingress is a bigger change than this decision |
| Tyk or Kong | a control plane, a datastore, a plugin runtime | through a plugin | plugin-defined | Rich API management whose one unique value here — edge OpenAPI validation — is redundant with in-service validation ([ADR-0303](0303-api-contracts-and-lifecycle.md)) |
| Traefik's commercial OIDC middleware | none | no — OIDC | headers | Closes the JWT gap in Traefik's open distribution, and is a paid tier ([ADR-0000](0000-platform-foundations.md), principle 3) |
| A DIY ForwardAuth service | one first-party service | yes, once written | ours | Viable, and it puts auth-critical validation under our ownership. Oathkeeper is the same shape, declarative, and maintained by someone else |

**The OIDC mismatch is what eliminates most of the field.** Kratos issues browser sessions, not OIDC tokens; Hydra issues OAuth2 tokens for third-party clients ([ADR-0304](0304-identity-and-authorization.md)). Every proxy above that expects an OIDC provider therefore needs Hydra inserted into the first-party browser path, which is an OAuth2 flow added to serve the proxy rather than any consumer.

## Decision

The edge is **Traefik fronting Ory Oathkeeper**. No full API-management gateway is deployed by default.

### Validate once, headers everywhere after

```text
Internet
  → Traefik       TLS, routing, load balancing, rate limiting
  → Oathkeeper    validate Kratos session or Hydra JWT → strip → inject X-User-Id / X-Org-Id / X-Roles
  → service       reads identity headers only; Checker authorises

service → service forwards the same headers; NetworkPolicy gates reachability; no token on the path
```

Oathkeeper **strips any client-supplied identity headers** before setting authoritative ones. Services read identity only from those headers and never parse a JWT — `authmw` is a trusted-header reader ([ADR-0304](0304-identity-and-authorization.md)).

This is the single request shape: every service, edge-origin or internal, reads identity identically.

**A denial at the edge looks like a denial from a service.** Oathkeeper rejects before any handler runs, so it is the platform's other error producer, and its `401` and `403` responses carry `application/problem+json` in the shape [ADR-0303](0303-api-contracts-and-lifecycle.md) fixes — same members, same `trace_id` extension. A generated client therefore has one error branch, not one per producer. Oathkeeper's error handlers are configured for this rather than left at their default body.

### Where this sits against zero trust

A reader who knows [NIST SP 800-207](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/207/final) will stop at the diagram above, because a service that trusts a header is the thing zero trust exists to eliminate. The position is deliberate: **this platform takes 800-207's authorization model and declines its transport model.**

| Tenet | Here |
| --- | --- |
| Access is granted per-request and per-resource, evaluated dynamically | **held.** Every protected call goes through `Checker` against OpenFGA ([ADR-0304](0304-identity-and-authorization.md)). Nothing is authorised merely by having reached the service |
| All communication is secured regardless of network location | **held.** WireGuard encrypts all east-west pod traffic ([ADR-0206](0206-cluster-networking.md)) |
| No implicit trust is derived from network position | **declined.** A service trusts `X-User-Id` because Cilium default-deny guarantees only sanctioned callers reach its port and Oathkeeper strips client-supplied headers at the edge. That is positional trust, which is precisely the assumption 800-207 removes |

The concession buys handlers with no auth code, one identity shape for every caller, no per-hop token minting or verification, and no sidecar on the hot path. It costs this: code executing inside a sanctioned caller can forge identity to a downstream service. The blast radius is that caller's own egress allowances, bounded further by the `restricted` profile limiting what a compromised pod can do at all ([ADR-0200](0200-cluster-topology.md)).

**The seam is built, and its trigger belongs to this platform rather than to an auditor.** [ADR-0206](0206-cluster-networking.md) makes per-workload certificate identity a Cilium mutual-auth and SPIFFE upgrade. It fires on any of three conditions:

| Trigger | Why it is the right threshold |
| --- | --- |
| A service performs a **monetary mutation** | The concession's cost is a forged identity accepted by a downstream service. Where that buys money rather than data, the blast radius stops being bounded by egress allowances |
| A **second team** owns a service in this cluster | Positional trust assumes every sanctioned caller is code this team reviewed. A second owner makes "sanctioned" a claim about someone else's review |
| Compliance requires an **auditable CA chain** | The external reason, and the weakest of the three: it fires on someone else's calendar rather than on this platform's risk |

Taking it converts positional trust into cryptographic trust and changes the transport only — the authorization half is 800-207's already, so nothing above it moves.

The first two are conditions this platform can observe in its own repository, which is what keeps its largest accepted risk from depending on an external party noticing it. The example `payment` service does not fire the first: it moves no money and holds no processor credential ([ADR-0302](0302-temporal.md)). A service that does is a different claim, and it is the one that fires.

### Rate limiting

Traefik's middleware throttles auth-sensitive routes — login, signup, password reset — per source from day one, as a security control independent of any public API.

**Per-API-key tiered quotas are deferred.** They are a full-API-management feature, and nothing else in the gateway is wanted.

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Trigger** | a project bills for API access, so a caller's quota differs by contract rather than by route |
| **Seam** | ✓ the public API is already a distinct audience with its own routes ([ADR-0303](0303-api-contracts-and-lifecycle.md)), so a gateway is placed in front of those routes only, behind a per-project flag. First-party browser traffic keeps the path above |
| **Cost if adopted late** | the API has already been billed against counters kept somewhere else — usually in a service — and those become the migration, not the gateway |

### Security headers and Origin policy

The edge is the one place every route passes through, so blanket headers live here.

| Control | Where |
| --- | --- |
| `frame-ancestors 'none'`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `Referrer-Policy`, HSTS | a Traefik `Middleware` on all responses — these directives never vary per request |
| The nonce-bearing `script-src` directive | the frontend ([ADR-0400](0400-frontend.md)) |
| **CSRF Origin check** | an Oathkeeper rule rejecting cookie-authenticated state-changing requests whose `Origin` is not the project's own domain. Bearer-token traffic is not browser-attached and is exempt |

The Origin check backstops the `SameSite=Lax` cookie ([ADR-0304](0304-identity-and-authorization.md)) and the Next.js Server-Actions check ([ADR-0400](0400-frontend.md)).

### Configuration and routing

| Concern | Location |
| --- | --- |
| Oathkeeper access rules | `infra/auth/oathkeeper/` as declarative YAML, deployed alongside Kratos and Hydra |
| Traefik routing, rate limits, middleware | `infra/gateway/` as Traefik CRDs, committed ([ADR-0101](0101-monorepo.md)) |

**Flat resource routing.** The API is a flat namespace ([ADR-0306](0306-trust-tiers-and-urls.md)), so the edge routes each resource prefix to its backing service through a per-resource `PathPrefix` rule. Service topology stays hidden and a resource can move between services without a URL change.

**The route table is the single registry of resource ownership**, and a CI lint fails if two edge-exposed specs claim the same prefix ([ADR-0303](0303-api-contracts-and-lifecycle.md)). Oathkeeper matches one rule on the whole `/api/` prefix and does not enumerate services.

There is no gateway-specific API-definition codegen. The spec drives service codegen; the edge does not consume it.

### Hydra is a public-API flag

Hydra issues OAuth2 tokens for third-party and external machine clients. **Internal-only projects do not deploy it** — Kratos, Oathkeeper, and OpenFGA are the internal stack. A project exposing a public API sets `hydra_thirdparty: on`, and Oathkeeper then validates those JWTs and converts them to the same identity headers, so **the internal request shape is unchanged**.

### Authz boundary

- The edge validates identity and injects headers. It does **not** call the authz engine.
- Services receive the headers and decide permissions through the shared client.
- Service-to-service calls bypass the edge, authorise the forwarded identity the same way, and NetworkPolicy decides which services may reach which.

The one sanctioned exception is operator tooling, which is third-party and cannot call `Checker`. That gate is [ADR-0304](0304-identity-and-authorization.md)'s.

### Developer portals

Both portals render the specs as **filtered projections on the `x-audience` ladder**, never separately maintained documents, and both render the edge `/api` surface. East-west operations appear in neither and are documented in service READMEs.

Scalar's request console is why the dev portal is same-origin with `/api` ([ADR-0306](0306-trust-tiers-and-urls.md)): "try it" hits the real edge with the caller's session and needs no CORS. The renderer, the route group, and the rejected alternatives are [ADR-0400](0400-frontend.md)'s; the projections are [ADR-0303](0303-api-contracts-and-lifecycle.md)'s.

## Consequences

### Positive

- One identity shape across the platform, and service handlers are auth-free.
- The edge validator is one Go binary in a family already operated: no Redis, no plugin runtime, no gateway codegen.
- JWT validation lives at exactly one hardened chokepoint rather than being duplicated into every service.

### Negative / Risks

- **Header trust internally rests on NetworkPolicy.** A misconfigured policy would let a pod spoof `X-User-Id`. Mitigated by default-deny in the service template and by Hubble flows as the audit surface ([ADR-0200](0200-cluster-topology.md)). This is the recorded deviation from NIST SP 800-207 above, not an unexamined gap, and it is the one property the SPIFFE seam exists to convert.
- **No edge schema validation.** Mitigated by generated in-service validation from the same spec. Internal calls bypass the edge anyway, so the service is the only point that sees every request.
- **Per-API-key quotas are unavailable on day one.** Accepted, and reintroduced per project when a monetised public API is real.
- **Oathkeeper is one more component to operate.** Accepted; it shares the Ory operational model.

## Rules

- Ingress is Traefik with TLS from cert-manager over ACME DNS-01. Oathkeeper sits behind it as the edge identity filter; there is no API-management gateway. `(ref: RFC 8555)`
- The edge is Traefik fronting Ory Oathkeeper. No full API-management gateway is deployed by default.
- Oathkeeper validates the Kratos session or Hydra JWT, strips client-supplied identity headers, and injects the authoritative ones. It does not call the authz engine. `(CI: lint:authz)`
- Every request carries identity in the same header shape. Services read identity from headers and never parse a token. `(CI: lint:auth-inline)`
- Service-to-service calls bypass the edge, forward the identity headers, and are gated by NetworkPolicy. No token is on the internal path.
- Request-schema validation is service-side. There is no edge schema validation.
- Edge denials return `application/problem+json` in the shape [ADR-0303](0303-api-contracts-and-lifecycle.md) fixes, carrying `trace_id`. Oathkeeper's default error body is not shipped. `(ref: RFC 9457)`
- Rate limiting on auth-sensitive routes is Traefik middleware in `infra/gateway/`.
- Static browser-security headers are a Traefik middleware on all responses; the per-request CSP nonce is the frontend's.
- Cookie-authenticated state-changing requests are Origin-checked by an Oathkeeper rule. Bearer-token traffic is exempt.
- The edge routes each resource prefix to its backing service, and the route table is the single registry of resource ownership. `(CI: lint:service-contract)`
- Hydra is deployed only for projects exposing a public API or external machine clients.
- A project needing tiered per-API-key quotas adds a full gateway for its own routes by its own decision. It is not the platform default.
