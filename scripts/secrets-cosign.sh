# Generate the platform's image-signing key pair (ADR-0104, ADR-0202).
#
#   mise run secrets:cosign
#
# ONE pair for the platform, not one per environment. An image is built once and
# the same digest flows dev → staging → prod (ADR-0103), so a per-environment key
# would mean an image that verifies in dev and is rejected in prod — the promotion
# model and per-environment signing keys cannot both be true.
#
# A task rather than a documented sequence of commands, and that is the decision
# ADR-0104 left open. The sequence is four steps that must all happen — generate,
# encrypt the private half, commit the public half where the policy reads it, and
# never let the private half touch the disk in the clear — and a documented sequence
# is one where the fourth step is the one someone skips. Here the private key exists
# as a file for the length of one `sops --encrypt`, in a directory this script owns
# and removes on the way out, including on failure.
#
# WHO HOLDS WHAT. The private half is decrypted by CI, which signs, and by nobody
# else: no cluster ever needs it, because Kyverno verifies with the public half.
# That is why it lands beside the other canonical auth material in infra/auth/
# rather than in an environment's SopsSecret bundle — a secret delivered to a
# cluster is a secret that cluster can be made to read.
#
# WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO is rotate. Rotation has an ordering constraint — the policy
# must trust both keys through the window, or the cluster stops being able to
# restart its own running images — and it is six steps in
# docs/guide/secrets-runbook.md.
