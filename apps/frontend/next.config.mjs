// Next.js config (ADR-0400). Standalone output is required for the Bun-only
// Dockerfile. One first-party package lives outside the app — `@libs/id`, the
// identifier codec both languages share (ADR-0003) — and it ships as TypeScript
// source with no build step, so Next has to transpile it like app code.

// Server Actions CSRF allowlist (ADR-0305, ADR-0400), derived from the one edge
// origin the BROWSER uses (EDGE_PUBLIC_ORIGIN) — deliberately not the internal
// origin a pod dials, which differs by port in-cluster and would allowlist the
// wrong host. See src/lib/server-fetch/server.ts for the split. Next compares the list against `new URL(origin).host`, which
// INCLUDES the port — hence `.host`, not the bare hostname: a `dev.localtest.me`
// entry can never match an `https://dev.localtest.me:8443` origin.
//
// This list is only consulted when Origin ≠ (X-Forwarded-)Host. ADR-0306 puts `/`
// and `/api` on the same origin, so that is already the common case and this is
// defence in depth. Note it is BUILD-time: `output: "standalone"` freezes this
// config into server.js, so a deployed image only carries an entry if the build
// passed EDGE_PUBLIC_ORIGIN — which pins that image to one env host and breaks the
// build-once/promote-by-digest flow in ADR-0103. Leave it unset in CI builds.
