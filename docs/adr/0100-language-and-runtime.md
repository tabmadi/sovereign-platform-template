# ADR-0100: Language & Runtime

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-08-06
- **Deciders:** Platform team
- **Related:** [ADR-0000](0000-platform-foundations.md), [ADR-0101](0101-monorepo.md), [ADR-0104](0104-supply-chain-security.md), [ADR-0204](0204-resource-management.md), [ADR-0302](0302-temporal.md), [ADR-0303](0303-api-contracts-and-lifecycle.md), [ADR-0400](0400-frontend.md), [ADR-0401](0401-internal-admin.md), [ADR-0500](0500-observability.md), [ADR-0600](0600-local-development-loop.md), [ADR-0601](0601-testing-strategy.md)
- **Decides:** Go is the backend language and TypeScript the frontend one, with no third general-purpose runtime and no ambient dependency.

## Context

The axis position set by [ADR-0000](0000-platform-foundations.md) — decomposition pressure high, operational sovereignty maximal, correctness stakes high — decides this. The product domain does not: two systems at the same axis position get the same answer here whatever they sell, and two systems in the same market routinely sit at opposite ends of every axis.

This ADR picks the **primary backend language**, the **conditions under which a second language is admitted**, and the **language and runtime the frontend is authored in**. The frontend framework is [ADR-0400](0400-frontend.md).

## Decision drivers

1. **The hiring intersection at this axis position.** Axis B at maximum needs one organisation to staff two roles: writing product services, and operating self-hosted Kubernetes ([ADR-0000](0000-platform-foundations.md), principle 3). What a language costs is the overlap between those pools, which is capacity — principle 3's binding constraint. The operated stack is one language's output and its operators concentrate there; readability in the product's language follows, and is a benefit rather than a second reason.
2. **Per-service cost against a fixed platform budget.** Axis A high: runtime, toolchain, base image, CI cache, and lint configuration are paid per service and per replica. A cost tolerable once is not tolerable across a fleet.
3. **Correctness affordances at axis C high.** Exact arithmetic, predictable concurrency, and types that refuse to represent an invalid state.
4. **A floor under the two SDKs every service links.** Every service is a durable-execution worker ([ADR-0302](0302-temporal.md)) and a telemetry producer ([ADR-0500](0500-observability.md)). Bindings that are community-maintained or pre-GA put a load-bearing path in the hands of one maintainer. **This admits or excludes a language; it does not rank the languages that clear it.**
5. **One language by default.** A second general-purpose backend language doubles the toolchain, codegen pipeline, CI cache, base image, lint configuration, and review pool. Only a capability the primary language cannot provide justifies it; preference does not.

## Considered options

| Option | Overlap with the operated stack | Axis C affordances | SDK floor | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Go** | **the stack itself** — Kubernetes and its controller ecosystem, ArgoCD, Traefik, Ory, Temporal's server, the OTel Collector, Prometheus, Loki, and Tempo | static types and CSP concurrency. **No decimal type in the standard library**, and no sum types | clears it, as four others do. Its OTel log signal is beta where .NET's and Java's are stable | **Chosen** on drivers 1 and 5. Verbose error handling and a thin type system are accepted; the arithmetic gap is closed below *(reasoned)* |
| Rust | no | the strongest on offer — exhaustive matching, no data races by construction, and [`sqlx`](https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx) checks every query against the live schema at compile time where `sqlc` infers it | **fails it** — Temporal is [first-party at public preview](https://temporal.io/changelog/rust-sdk-public-preview) rather than GA, and [OTel Rust](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/) is beta on all three signals | Best correctness in the field, and driver 4 is unmet while the velocity cost is paid per service. **Kept as an escape hatch** |
| .NET (C#) | no, and its cloud-native segment is Azure-shaped — managed Kubernetes, hosted CI — which is axis B *low* | native 128-bit `decimal`, records, pattern matching — stronger than Go | clears it. [OTel .NET](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/) is stable across all three signals | **The strongest alternative, and it loses on driver 1 alone.** Better than Go on driver 3, conceded below. The engineer who writes C# services *and* has operated self-hosted Kubernetes on hardware is the rare intersection; the Azure-native one is common and is a different axis position |
| JVM (Java/Kotlin) | no | `BigDecimal`; Kotlin adds sealed hierarchies and null tracking | clears it, on the most mature durable-execution SDK in the field | As .NET, plus a build tool and an application framework this ADR would have to choose, and native compilation is a second build mode under its own licence |
| TypeScript on Bun | no | discriminated unions are the best ergonomics here, and types are erased at runtime while numbers are IEEE-754 doubles | clears it | One language across the stack is the appeal. A single-threaded event loop and erased runtime types are the wrong default at axis C high. **Retained for the frontend**, where it is unavoidable |
| Python | no | native `decimal`; annotations are unenforced at runtime | clears it | **Kept as an escape hatch** where the library ecosystem is the reason the service exists |
| Elixir / BEAM | no | supervision trees and true process isolation; dynamically typed | **fails it** — no first-party durable-execution SDK | Its fault-tolerance model overlaps what Temporal and Kubernetes already provide here, so the platform pays for that property twice |
| Polyglot by team choice | mixed | mixed | mixed | The honest baseline. At axis A high the per-language cost multiplies by the number of teams rather than by services, and every shared library is written once per language |

**Runtime footprint no longer separates the compiled options.** [.NET Native AOT](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/deploying/native-aot/) and GraalVM native images put C# and Java in the same order of magnitude as a Go binary at idle and at startup. A decision made on resident memory would once have been decisive and is not, so drivers 1 and 3 carry it instead.

### The frontend language

The browser runs JavaScript, so this question is what compiles to it.

| Option | Type system | Ecosystem for the decided frontend | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **TypeScript** | structural, and erased at runtime | native — the framework and design system ([ADR-0400](0400-frontend.md)) and the generated client ([ADR-0303](0303-api-contracts-and-lifecycle.md)) each publish their own types | **Chosen.** It is the type layer this field publishes against, so no binding is written here |
| JavaScript | none | native | The generated client's contract types become comments, which is the one thing generating a client is for |
| ReScript | sound, and its own | a binding per library, written and maintained here | A stronger type system, paid for per dependency. Most of this frontend is other people's code |
| Elm | sound, and its own | none — interop is through ports | A different runtime model, and its React interop story is the one [ADR-0400](0400-frontend.md)'s component library sits on |

## Decision

| Concern | Decision |
| --- | --- |
| Primary backend language | **Go**, latest stable major |
| Frontend language | **TypeScript** |
| JS runtime for code we author | **Bun**, sole — install, workspaces, test, build, and the production server |
| Escape hatch: Rust | a measured CPU or latency requirement Go does not meet, or a domain whose canonical implementation exists only in Rust |
| Escape hatch: Python | the library ecosystem is the reason the service exists, and the service is a thin wrapper over it |
| A second general-purpose backend language | not adopted |

### Go is chosen for who can staff it

At axis B maximal the scarce role is not "a backend engineer" but one who can write product services and also debug a reconciliation loop, an admission webhook, an eBPF datapath, or a collector pipeline.

That second capability is the harder hire in any language. Choosing the operated stack's language does not make it easier; it makes the two pools adjacent, so a service engineer can grow into platform work and a platform engineer can review service code.

**The claim is about a labour market, so it decays.** It holds while cloud-native infrastructure remains one language's output and the operator population concentrates there. The re-derivation test: are engineers who have operated self-hosted Kubernetes still found predominantly in this language's adjacent roles? A language-popularity ranking does not answer that, and is not evidence for this driver.

Two limits bound the claim:

- The strongest platform engineers frequently do not identify by language, presenting as Platform Engineer, SRE, or DevOps. The overlap is smaller than the ecosystem's language share suggests.
- Infrastructure-depth searches run longer than API searches within the same language. This driver reduces that cost; it does not remove it.

**The driver does not weaken as other runtimes improve**, because it describes where people are rather than what a runtime does. It flips at a different axis position: a platform at axis B low operates none of that stack, needs no overlap, and decides on driver 3, where C# or Kotlin wins.

### Where Go is weak, and what carries the weight

Three gaps are real at axis C high, and none is closed by the language.

| Gap | What it costs | What carries the weight |
| --- | --- | --- |
| No decimal type in the standard library | a `float64` monetary amount compiles and surfaces later as a rounding discrepancy | one shared money type in `libs/go/money/`, over `math/big` in the standard library. A monetary value is that type — at rest, in the contract, and on the wire |
| No sum types, so an invalid state is representable | an illegal state transition compiles | state that must not go invalid is a workflow, where Temporal owns the transitions ([ADR-0302](0302-temporal.md)) |
| Errors are unchecked values | an ignored error compiles | `errcheck` in `golangci-lint` |

`math/big` supplies the arithmetic and none of what makes money correct: a currency that cannot be added to another, a rounding mode chosen rather than inherited, a `numeric` column mapping, and a **string** JSON form. A JSON number is an IEEE-754 double by the time a TypeScript client reads it, so the wire form is a string whatever the Go type is. Those four properties are the type; the arithmetic is the standard library's, and no third-party decimal package is introduced.

The platform does not pretend Go is the strongest instrument for driver 3 — C# and Kotlin are. Driver 1 ranks above them because driver 3's gaps have the mitigations listed above and driver 1's have none: no library widens a hiring pool.

### What would change this decision

Driver 1 rests on a stack this ADR does not choose and on a labour market it does not control, and driver 4 is a floor rather than a ranking. Neither is a vote for the tools named in them.

| Change | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| The workflow engine is replaced | **None.** It is one dependency inside a service, and the floor screens its replacement identically |
| The observability stack is replaced | **None.** Instrumentation is vendor-neutral by [ADR-0500](0500-observability.md)'s own driver, and the backends sit behind it |
| The identity stack or the edge proxy is replaced | **None.** Both have credible equivalents in other languages, rejected on configuration-as-code and licence grounds rather than on language |
| The position on axis B moves down | **Decisive.** The operated stack dissolves, the roles stop needing to overlap, driver 1 evaporates, and driver 3 decides instead |
| The operator population stops concentrating in one language | **Decisive**, and it is the condition driver 1 is stated against. Re-derive per *Go is chosen for who can staff it* above |

The orchestration and controller layer is what makes driver 1 robust rather than incidental. Identity could have been a JVM product and so could the telemetry stores, and those substitutions leave the decision intact.

At axis B maximal no non-Go orchestrator is a real option, and that layer is where the custom controllers and the patches are written. That layer, rather than a count of projects, is what fixes where the operators are.

### The JS runtime

| Option | Node API compatibility | Toolchain components | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Bun** | **the highest of the three** | **one binary** — runtime, package manager, workspaces, test runner, and bundler | **Chosen.** Driver 2 applied to the toolchain itself *(reasoned)* |
| Node.js | the definition of it | a package manager, a test runner, and a bundler selected, pinned, cached, and upgraded separately | Loses on driver 2. Each addition is a version to pin and a supply-chain edge ([ADR-0104](0104-supply-chain-security.md)) |
| Deno | lowest, reached through an `npm:` specifier | comparable to Bun | A second permissions model and a second registry, for no capability this platform needs |

The frontend framework's own vendor ships first-party Bun support, while the framework's self-hosting documentation does not cover the runtime ([vercel/next.js#55272](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/55272)). That gap is covered by end-to-end tests running against the built image ([ADR-0601](0601-testing-strategy.md)), not by upstream documentation.

### The three Node islands

Node runs vendored third-party tools, never code we author and never a backend runtime. There are exactly three, none in the root toolchain, so an engineer who touches none of them never installs Node. They are the price of the Bun decision, enumerated rather than discovered.

| Island | Why Node is unavoidable | Containment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Playwright e2e and visual runner ([ADR-0601](0601-testing-strategy.md)) | browser-process control needs extra-fd pipe transport and worker IPC that Bun does not match, and the gap is upstream rather than in our usage — Bun's own author's [support patch](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/pull/28875) and the [feature request](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/38095) are both unmerged | `test/e2e/.mise.toml`, runner and CI only |
| Lowdefy admin console ([ADR-0401](0401-internal-admin.md)) | installed and run rather than built, so the runtime is upstream's choice. Its CLI aborts without `pnpm` on `PATH`, and `lowdefy start` shells to `next start`, whose bin is `#!/usr/bin/env node`. Bun displaces that only by aliasing `node`, and still needs pnpm | `apps/admin/.mise.toml` and that app's image |
| API mock ([ADR-0600](0600-local-development-loop.md)) | the only OpenAPI-3.1-complete contract mock is a Node program | consumed as a pinned upstream container, so it installs no Node anywhere and adds no `package.json` |

### What makes a language an escape hatch

An escape hatch adds a capability Go lacks. A language that does what Go already does is a **substitute**: adopting one buys nothing and pays driver 5 in full. That is why JVM, .NET, and a JavaScript backend are barred with or without an ADR, each being stronger than Go on driver 3 and none adding a capability.

Rust and Python are complements rather than substitutes, and each is admitted only on the condition in the decision table. Correctness preference is driver 3, and driver 3 does not outrank driver 5 on its own.

Every escape-hatch service carries its own ADR recording the measured need, and a Rust service additionally records how it satisfies [ADR-0500](0500-observability.md) given the maturity of its telemetry SDKs. A third escape hatch amends this ADR.

## Consequences

### Positive

- One language across the fleet: `libs/go/` is shared unconditionally, with one lint and format configuration, one base image, and one codegen pipeline. An engineer moves between services without a toolchain.
- **The platform and the product are written in the same language.** A stack trace out of a third-party component is readable, and a fix to one is an ordinary pull request rather than an upstream issue and a wait.
- **A service engineer and a platform engineer are drawn from adjacent pools.** Cover during an absence, and growth from the first role into the second, do not require a second language.
- A service's resident memory is dominated by its own working set rather than by its runtime, so fleet capacity tracks workload ([ADR-0204](0204-resource-management.md)).
- Generated TypeScript clients give cross-language type sharing without a second backend language ([ADR-0303](0303-api-contracts-and-lifecycle.md)).
- The decision is derived from the axis position, so a project adopting this template at a different position knows which driver to re-run rather than having to re-argue the language.

### Negative / Risks

- **Go is not the strongest available language on driver 3.** Accepted, on the ranking argued above.
- **Driver 1 is the weakest-evidenced driver here.** A labour market cannot be measured the way a language feature can, so it carries a re-derivation test rather than a figure, and a project in a different market re-runs it before inheriting the answer.
- Verbose error handling is accepted. No bespoke error-handling DSLs.
- **The money type is first-party code on a correctness-critical path.** A bug in it is a bug in every price, total, and ledger entry at once, where a language with a native decimal inherits a vetted implementation instead. It carries no third-party dependency, so the exposure is ours to test rather than ours to trust.
- **Bun is a single-vendor runtime with one implementation.** The exit is affordable only because its Node API compatibility is high enough to run the same code on Node, which the islands already show is installable.
- Every escape-hatch service is a permanent tax: a toolchain, codegen pipeline, CI cache, base image, and review pool that exist for one service.

## Rules

- Every backend service is written in Go. Another language requires its own ADR admitting the service under a documented escape hatch.
- The Go version is pinned by the root `.mise.toml` and no service overrides it. Only a release still receiving upstream security fixes is pinned — the two most recent major releases ([Go release policy](https://go.dev/doc/devel/release)). `(CI: ci:lint)`
- A monetary amount is the shared money type, never a floating-point number — `numeric` in the database, a string in the OpenAPI schema, and a string on the wire. `(CI: lint:money)`
- The frontend is TypeScript.
- Bun is the only JS runtime for code we author. No Go service image, the frontend image, or any artifact built from our own source installs Node. `(CI: lint:node-scope)`
- Node is never pinned in the root `.mise.toml`. An island that installs Node pins it in its own island config against the root `[env] NODE_VERSION`; an island shipping as a container pins no Node at all. A fourth Node island requires amending this ADR. `(CI: lint:node-scope)`
- A Rust service requires its own ADR recording measured Go inadequacy or a Rust-native canonical ecosystem, and how the service satisfies [ADR-0500](0500-observability.md).
- A Python service requires its own ADR and is admitted only where the library ecosystem is the reason the service exists.
- JVM, .NET, and JavaScript backends are not permitted, with or without an ADR.
- Cross-language sharing happens through generated OpenAPI clients, never a shared in-process runtime.
