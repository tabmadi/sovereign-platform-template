# `cluster:base` (ADR-0205, ADR-0600) — the local floor every service needs.
#
#   Traefik · cert-manager · Postgres · Kratos · Oathkeeper   real
#   Temporal · OpenFGA · CNPG · observability · ArgoCD        absent, opt-in per service
#
# Everything above the floor is opt-in, declared by the service that needs it
# (`dep:*` in each `services/<svc>/.mise.toml`) rather than by a named profile.
# There is no `min`/`backend`/`edge`/`obs` tier: what is up is base ∪ the declared
# dependencies of whatever you are running. See ADR-0205.
#
# The identity stack is in the floor deliberately (ADR-0600's argument, generalised
# from the frontend to every service): Kratos and Oathkeeper are cheap, and their
# behaviour — cookies, CSRF, session expiry, the 401/403 — IS the contract every
# service consumes. A service reached through this edge gets real Oathkeeper
# identity headers; one curled directly is being handed forged ones. So the auth
# path is byte-identical to production — no bypass, no development provider, no
# NODE_ENV branch, because nothing needs one.
#
# This is a SELECTION, not a copy: every component is installed from the same chart
# and the same `infra/gitops/platform/local/values.yaml` overlay that cluster:full
# uses. This script names which ones, and nothing else — no second values file to
# drift.
#
# Not ArgoCD-driven, deliberately: Argo is the full tier's engine (ADR-0205), and
# this is the inner loop.
#
# Related: `scripts/dep-apply.sh` adds one opt-in component on top of this floor;
# `mise run cluster:edge-glue` re-stamps the host edge glue alone (hidden; this
# script and the start/reboot paths already run it for you).

# 3. TLS. cert-manager IS the mechanism in every environment (ADR-0205); only the
#    issuer differs, and the local values already select the SelfSigned one.
#    Helm applies the chart's ClusterIssuer/Certificates in the same pass that
#    creates the webhook they must be admitted by, so a cold install can lose that
#    race ("no endpoints available for service cert-manager-webhook"). ArgoCD
#    solves it with sync-waves; imperatively the honest fix is to wait for the
#    webhook and apply again — the retry is doing what wave 1 does, not papering
#    over a flake.
step "installing cert-manager + the self-signed wildcard issuer"
# `build` reads Chart.lock and needs the dependency's repository already
# registered in the caller's helm config; `update` resolves it from the URL in
# Chart.yaml. On a developer machine the repo is usually registered from some
# earlier run, so `build` alone works and keeps working — and fails on a clean
# runner with "no repository definition", which is exactly what happened the
# first time CI ran this. Build first because it is the cheap offline path;
# fall back to update, which is what every other script here already uses.

# TWO passes, because there are two orderings to satisfy and Helm gives us neither
# inside one release.
#
#   1. The CRDs are TEMPLATES of the subchart, not files in its crds/ directory, so
#      Helm renders the whole release in one go and validates this chart's own
#      `cert-manager.io/v1` objects against an API server that has never heard of
#      that group. On a cluster where the CRDs already exist — anyone's second run —
#      it is invisible; on a fresh one the install cannot even render:
#      "no matches for kind Certificate … ensure CRDs are installed first".
#   2. Then the webhook has to be admitting before the Certificates apply, which is
#      the race the retry below was always for.
#
# ArgoCD needs neither: sync-waves on the issuers order them after the CRDs, which
# is why the full tier has always worked and this path was never exercised clean.

# 3b. The PriorityClasses every service chart names (ADR-0204). Cluster-scoped and

#    does not run.
# The local age key is committed (ADR-0202's one exemption), and the template ships

✓ cluster:base up — real edge + real identity + Postgres.

  Add what you need on top — nothing else is running:
    cd services/<svc> && mise run server    native, pulls its own deps in
    mise run cluster:add -- <svc>           in-cluster, from the working tree

  Open:          https://${DOMAIN}:8443/
  Log in as:     ${login_identity}
                 (committed throwaway credentials; sessions last 7 days. The full
                 credential table is docs/dev-loop.md)
  Teardown:      mise run cluster:stop  (keep cache) / cluster:delete (delete)

  Base alone serves no application data: /api routes 404 until something answers
  behind them — a service you add, or the contract mock:
    mise run mock:start                     /api from the committed OpenAPI

  The auth path is complete either way — logging in, CSRF, expiry and the
  Oathkeeper 401/403 all behave as they do in production.

  Persistence here is ephemeral (the Postgres stand-in has no volume) and no
  workflow runs without dep:temporal. Assert persistence, Temporal behaviour and
  authorization decisions against real services on cluster:full.
