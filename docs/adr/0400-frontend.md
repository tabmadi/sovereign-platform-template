# ADR-0400: Frontend Stack & Conventions

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-08-06
- **Deciders:** Platform team
- **Related:** [ADR-0100](0100-language-and-runtime.md), [ADR-0101](0101-monorepo.md), [ADR-0201](0201-gitops.md), [ADR-0302](0302-temporal.md), [ADR-0303](0303-api-contracts-and-lifecycle.md), [ADR-0304](0304-identity-and-authorization.md), [ADR-0305](0305-edge-auth-and-traffic-policy.md), [ADR-0306](0306-trust-tiers-and-urls.md), [ADR-0401](0401-internal-admin.md), [ADR-0500](0500-observability.md), [ADR-0501](0501-operator-uis-and-dashboards.md), [ADR-0600](0600-local-development-loop.md), [ADR-0601](0601-testing-strategy.md)
- **Decides:** One Next.js app with route groups, server components by default, and Untitled UI on Tailwind wired CSS-first.

## Context

One Next.js app under `apps/frontend/` is the front door for landing pages, the authenticated product panel, and the developer portal, all as route groups. The internal admin console is a separate application ([ADR-0401](0401-internal-admin.md)). Earlier ADRs pin language, runtime, deployment, codegen, and auth integration. None pins how the app is built day to day.

This ADR is the single entry point for a newcomer working on the frontend.

### Pinned by earlier ADRs

| Concern | Decision | ADR |
| --- | --- | --- |
| App count and route groups | one app, route groups `(landing\|panel\|devportal)` | [ADR-0101](0101-monorepo.md) |
| Language and runtime | TypeScript, Bun as the only JS runtime | [ADR-0100](0100-language-and-runtime.md) |
| Workspaces | Bun workspaces, no Turborepo | [ADR-0101](0101-monorepo.md) |
| API clients | generated from each service's spec | [ADR-0303](0303-api-contracts-and-lifecycle.md) |
| Login UI | custom Next.js driving Kratos self-service flows | [ADR-0304](0304-identity-and-authorization.md) |
| Container | standalone output, deployed via the shared service chart | [ADR-0101](0101-monorepo.md), [ADR-0201](0201-gitops.md) |
| Cross-route-group imports | lint-forbidden | [ADR-0101](0101-monorepo.md) |

## Decision drivers

1. **One stack for every route group.** Landing, panel, and devportal share the same primitives, and adding a route group decides nothing new.
2. **The generated SDK is called from a server the platform runs.** A public marketing page, an authenticated panel, and an API console have different rendering needs, and the API credential must never reach the browser to satisfy any of them.
3. **The design system is the contract with design**, so the primitive library's fidelity to the design tool is a capability, not a preference.
4. **Running it is a container in this cluster**, with no build-time or runtime dependency on the vendor's hosting.
5. **Governance is recorded, not decisive** ([ADR-0000](0000-platform-foundations.md), principle 4). Exit cost sets how much a vendor relationship is allowed to weigh.

## Considered options

### Framework

Every option below is MIT and self-hostable as a container, so the column that matters is what self-hosting *costs* — which features quietly assume the vendor's platform.

| Option | Server rendering model | Cost of self-hosting | Governance | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Next.js, App Router** | Server Components by default, with a client boundary opt-in | `output: standalone` is a first-party target. Image optimisation and incremental regeneration need a cache and a resizer that the vendor otherwise supplies | **Vercel** | **Chosen.** The server-first model is driver 2 as a default rather than an assembly job, and its self-hosting gaps are a cache and a resizer, both replaceable and both inside the cluster *(documented)* |
| TanStack Start | client-first, with server functions | no vendor path to depend on | TanStack, vendor-neutral, community-funded | **The strongest alternative on driver 5** — the only option here outside a hosting vendor's orbit. Younger, and its server story is server functions rather than a component-level boundary, which puts driver 2 back in the author's hands on every page |
| React Router, which absorbed Remix | loaders and actions per route, client rendering by default | none — it was built to run anywhere | Shopify | Mature, and the model is a data-router rather than a server-component one. Choosing it accepts a larger client bundle on the marketing routes to gain nothing the panel needs |
| SvelteKit | server load functions, compiled output, smallest bundles | none; adapters target plain Node | Svelte, with its creator employed by **Vercel** | The best bundle sizes in the field. It is not React, so [ADR-0401](0401-internal-admin.md)'s console, the component library, and the hiring pool all change with it |
| Nuxt | Vue, server routes via Nitro | none; Nitro targets a plain Node server | Nuxt is MIT and independently governed; **NuxtLabs was acquired by Vercel in 2025** | As SvelteKit: a different component ecosystem for no gain the panel can name. Notable for driver 5 — moving away from Vercel is not what picking it buys |
| Astro | islands, static by default | none | Astro Technology Company | Correct for the landing routes and wrong for the panel. Adopting it means two frameworks, which is driver 1 |
| A single-page app plus a separate static site | none | none | n/a | The honest baseline. Two build pipelines, two deploy targets, and the API credential has nowhere to live but the browser |

**Driver 5 does not rescue any of them.** Vercel employs the Next.js team, acquired NuxtLabs, and employs Svelte's creator, so three of the six options sit in one vendor's orbit and only TanStack Start is outside it. Since every option is MIT and runs as a container here, the governance column records a relationship rather than a dependency: the exit from Next.js is a rewrite of routing and data loading, which is expensive because of the framework's shape, not because of who funds it.

### Design system

Tier 1 by exit cost ([ADR-0002](0002-tool-adoption.md)), because it is the design-system contract rather than a component library: every screen is composed of it, and replacing it re-authors the markup of the whole surface. Compared on the two properties that survive that observation — where the source lives, and whether the design tool and the code agree.

| Option | Where the component source lives | Design-tool parity | Accessibility base | Licence | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Untitled UI React + Tailwind** | **vendored into the repository as source**, and edited like first-party code | a Figma kit the components are drawn from, so a design hand-off is a lookup rather than a translation *(documented)* | React Aria Components underneath | MIT for the React library; the Figma kit and PRO tiers are commercial *(documented)* | **Chosen.** Driver 3 is design-to-code fidelity, and this is the only option where the two artefacts are the same system rather than two interpretations of one |
| shadcn/ui | vendored as source — the same model | none first-party; the community kits are approximations | Radix underneath | MIT | **The runner-up, and the same shape.** It loses on the Figma row alone, which is the whole of driver 3. If the project has no designer, this is the better-supported choice |
| Mantine | an installed package | a community kit | its own, good | MIT | A complete library with its own styling engine, which is a second one beside Tailwind — principle 5 |
| Park UI | vendored as source, over Ark UI | a Figma kit | Ark UI underneath | MIT | The closest structural match to the choice, on a smaller ecosystem and a younger primitive layer |
| Material UI | an installed package | an official Figma kit, and the strongest parity in the field | its own, mature | MIT | The one option that beats the choice on driver 3. It carries an opinionated visual language that a product design system then fights, and Emotion is a second styling engine |
| Radix or React Aria plus hand-written components | ours | none | the primitives' | MIT / Apache-2.0 | The honest baseline, and it is what the chosen option is *plus* the components. Choosing it means authoring the design system, which is the work being bought |

**Vendoring as source is the property that makes the exit affordable.** The components are in the repository and are edited there, so abandoning upstream costs the updates rather than the code — which is what keeps a Tier 1 exit cost at the low end of Tier 1.

### Everything else

| Concern | Chosen | Rejected, and why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Router | **App Router** | Pages Router does not fit the server-heavy, small-bundle goal |
| Styling | **Tailwind, wired CSS-first** | CSS Modules and CSS-in-JS are viable, and the design contract is in Tailwind tokens, so mixing systems doubles the design-system surface |
| Primitives | **Untitled UI React**, vendored as source, built on React Aria Components | shadcn/ui is the strong contender and the same shape — copied source over headless primitives — and driver 3 decides it on Figma fidelity. Radix plus Tailwind by hand is the same thing without the components. Mantine and Park UI ship their own design language, which is the contract this driver reserves for design. **Its Figma kit and the PRO component tiers are commercial**; the React library is MIT, and only the MIT part is vendored |
| Lint and format | **Biome only** | Biome plus a minimal ESLint for the Next plugin is second-best. One tool wins; the Next-specific rules that matter are caught by `next build`, Lighthouse-CI, and the typed `next/image` and `next/font` APIs |
| Unit test runner | **`bun test`** | Vitest and Jest duplicate a Jest-compatible runner the only JS runtime already ships |
| Spec renderer | **Scalar** | Redoc's request console is paywalled, which negates the same-origin "try it" the URL layout was built for. A docs platform (Fern, Mintlify) is a separate stateful service duplicating the SDK codegen. **Stoplight Elements** is the equivalent-capability alternative, and the two are interchangeable because both render the same committed spec |
| Access-denial UI | **the framework's `unauthorized.js` and `forbidden.js` interrupts** | An error boundary carries no status, misses a Server Action's return path, and renders every denial as a crash. A per-page check is the same branch written once per route, and the one that is forgotten fails silently |
| Feature flags | **OpenFeature SDK, noop provider** | Vercel `flags` is runtime-specific and wrong for an in-cluster Bun runtime |
| Component catalogue | **an in-repo kitchen-sink route** | Storybook is useful and not load-bearing with one app, where Figma is already the isolated visual catalogue. The deferral below carries the condition |
| i18n | **deferred behind a trigger** | `next-intl` on day one is premature without a locale on the roadmap |
| Server-state fetching | **TanStack Query** for client-side reads | RSC-only means every interactive refetch becomes a route transition. SWR is lighter and lacks the mutation and invalidation model the panel uses |
| Client state | **Zustand** for the little that outlives a component tree | Jotai and Valtio are equivalent at this size, and the decision is which one rather than whether. XState is right for genuinely stateful flows and is a modelling commitment the panel does not need. Redux and MobX are on nobody's shortlist here |
| Forms | **`react-hook-form`** | TanStack Form is the closer competitor and is younger; Conform is server-action-first, which couples form code to one framework's action model |
| Browser telemetry | **Grafana Faro** through the collector | The OTel web SDK alone has no session or web-vitals story, and a Sentry browser SDK implies the error backend [ADR-0503](0503-error-tracking.md) declines |

## Decision

### Rendering

Components are server components by default, and `"use client"` is added at the smallest necessary interactivity boundary. Server Actions are permitted for form submission against the route group's owning service; cross-service mutations go through the service's REST API and the workflow-handle pattern ([ADR-0302](0302-temporal.md)).

Every route segment ships `loading.tsx` and `error.tsx`; every route-group root additionally ships `not-found.tsx`.

### Data fetching

| Context | Mechanism |
| --- | --- |
| Server components | the generated SDKs, through an app-local server-only fetcher marked `import "server-only"` that forwards the Kratos session cookie and W3C trace context. Direct `fetch` to service URLs is not used |
| Client components | TanStack Query wrapping the same SDKs, with query keys derived from `operationId` |
| Mutations | Server Actions when single-service; otherwise a `202 Accepted` workflow handle the client polls |

The `server-fetch` directory has **no barrel**: client code imports the client entry and server code the server entry, so server-only modules never leak into a client bundle.

### Styling

Untitled UI's integration is followed exactly, so a component copied from upstream drops in unmodified.

| Element | Decision |
| --- | --- |
| System | Tailwind, wired CSS-first with no config file. CSS Modules and CSS-in-JS are not used in app code; third-party components shipping their own styles are the exception |
| Tokens | Untitled UI's committed token file, imported by the global stylesheet. **There is no JS token mirror** — a TypeScript consumer needing a raw value reads the CSS variable |
| Plugins and variants | the global stylesheet registers the React Aria state-variant and animate plugins and declares Untitled's custom variants |
| Class composition | Untitled's `cx` and `sortCx`. Hand-written `cn()` helpers are not added |
| Dark mode | `next-themes`, writing Untitled's class on the root element |

Token edits are PRs. Upstream bumps are recorded in `apps/frontend/src/components/UPSTREAM.md` on a yearly cadence.

### Code layout: one app, no first-party packages

There is exactly one consumer of the frontend code. Route groups are folders in that app — one bundle, one `node_modules` — not independent build targets.

**A workspace package earns its keep only on a second independent consumer, or for a generated artifact.** Splitting single-consumer code into packages buys nothing and costs real ceremony: per-package dependencies, peer dependencies to keep a single React instance, transpile configuration, and path aliases. Under Bun's isolated linker that ceremony is load-bearing, so a missing entry is a build break rather than a lint nit.

| Code | Location |
| --- | --- |
| UI primitives | `src/components/{base,application,foundations}/` |
| Design tokens | `src/styles/` |
| `cx` / `sortCx` and helpers | `src/utils/` |
| Server and client fetchers | `src/lib/server-fetch/` |
| Browser and server telemetry | `src/lib/observability/` |
| Feature flags | `src/lib/feature-flags.ts` |
| User-facing strings | `src/strings/<route-group>.ts` |
| Generated API SDKs | `libs/ts/sdks/<service>/` — the **only** `libs/ts` members |

### Component library

Primitives live under `src/components/` in Untitled UI's own layout. Route groups compose them by explicit path and do not duplicate them. The heuristic: if two route groups would copy a component, it belongs under `src/components/`.

Untitled UI ships source the project owns, built on [React Aria Components](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/) for accessibility, vendored as committed source rather than fetched at runtime. Keeping upstream's folder layout and utility names verbatim is deliberate: it makes adding a component or taking a yearly bump a clean diff rather than a rewrite.

**The kitchen-sink page** renders every primitive once. It is the cheap alternative to Storybook: one route, no separate toolchain, gated by the devportal session. Every primitive added under `src/components/` gets a section there in the same PR.

### Accessibility

**The target is [WCAG 2.2 level AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/)** across every route group. AA is the level EN 301 549 and Section 508 reference, so it is what a procurement question or a regulator asks about. AAA is not adopted: WCAG itself declines to recommend it as a whole-site target, because some of its criteria cannot be satisfied for all content.

React Aria supplies keyboard behaviour, focus management, and ARIA semantics for the primitives. That is the floor rather than the target — contrast, heading structure, landmark semantics, and error association are composition decisions no primitive library makes.

| Surface | Claim |
| --- | --- |
| `(landing)`, `(panel)`, `(devportal)` | WCAG 2.2 AA |
| The kitchen-sink page | AA per primitive. A primitive's conformance is proven once here rather than re-proven in every consumer |
| Scalar's rendered console | not claimed — a vendored island with its own theme. The route group around it is AA |
| Operator tooling: Lowdefy, Grafana, pgweb ([ADR-0401](0401-internal-admin.md), [ADR-0501](0501-operator-uis-and-dashboards.md)) | not claimed. Third-party UIs behind an operator session, and the exclusion is stated rather than assumed |

**Enforcement is `@axe-core/playwright`** inside the existing e2e suite ([ADR-0601](0601-testing-strategy.md)) — no second toolchain. Every kitchen-sink section and every product journey is scanned, and a `serious` or `critical` violation fails the merge. Colour contrast is additionally checked against the design-token file rather than per component, because a token change moves every surface at once.

### Developer portal renderer

The devportal route group renders the OpenAPI specs through **Scalar**, embedded as a client island — never a separate service.

| Property | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Why Scalar | a built-in, free request console. Being same-origin with `/api` ([ADR-0306](0306-trust-tiers-and-urls.md)), "try it" calls the real edge with the caller's session and needs no CORS |
| What it renders | a **pre-filtered projection**, not the raw specs. `gen:openapi-public` merges the service specs and filters on the `x-audience` ladder, so the renderer only ever sees what its audience may see. The strip is real, not a UI hide ([ADR-0303](0303-api-contracts-and-lifecycle.md)) |
| Self-hosted | the package is bundled by the build rather than loaded from a CDN, and default web fonts are disabled, so nothing is fetched at runtime |
| CSP fit | it injects inline styles, covered by `style-src`; self-hosts its fonts, covered by `font-src 'self'`; and its console fetches same-origin, covered by `connect-src 'self'` |
| Visual island | Scalar ships its own theme and the portal does not reuse Untitled UI primitives. Accepted for one route group: matching a spec renderer to the design system is not worth the maintenance, and the console is worth more than pixel parity |

The **public docs portal** is anonymous with no login, the norm for public API documentation, and renders only `public` operations. It ships only when a public API does. Credential management is a separate authenticated surface ([ADR-0306](0306-trust-tiers-and-urls.md)): viewing docs never requires an account, only managing keys does.

### Forms, state, and auth wiring

| Concern | Decision |
| --- | --- |
| Forms | `react-hook-form` for orchestration, `zod` for schemas. Schemas for spec operations are generated and committed, drift-checked in CI. One `<Form>` primitive wires all three; hand-rolled form wiring is a review-blocker |
| URL state | `nuqs` for filters, pagination, tab selection |
| Client-only state | Zustand, for state that outlives a component tree. Redux and MobX are not used |
| React Context | theming and per-route-group session bootstrapping only, never cross-cutting state |
| Session | the Next.js proxy checks the Kratos session on `(panel)` and `(devportal)`; `(landing)` is public except its auth subtree. The proxy forwards a session-id header to server components, which never call Kratos directly |
| Tokens | the frontend never mints, decodes, or validates JWTs. Server-component calls attach the user's cookie, and Oathkeeper validates it at the edge |

### Access denials

[RFC 9110](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-15.5.2) splits the two failures, and the split decides the UI.

| Failure | Means | Answer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 401 | the request carries no usable session | redirect to the login flow, carrying path and query — signing in is the remedy |
| 403 | the session is valid and the resource is refused | render at the denied address — signing in is no remedy, and the address is what the user gives to whoever grants access |

The denial is raised in the fetch clients rather than by each caller: to a generated client a 403 is an empty result rather than an exception, and a page that renders it reads as a service returning no data. That is [CWE-280](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/280.html), which the [OWASP Authorization Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Authorization_Cheat_Sheet.html) names.

The decision itself stays server-side, at the edge and in the service ([ADR-0304](0304-identity-and-authorization.md), [ADR-0305](0305-edge-auth-and-traffic-policy.md)) — [ASVS](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/) V1.4.1 and V4.1.1. The frontend renders the answer and computes no permission.

**A streamed response cannot carry the status.** The status line precedes the body, so a denial raised after the first `await` beneath a Suspense boundary arrives inside a `200` ([Next.js `loading.js`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/loading#status-codes)). `notFound()` behaves the same, so the property belongs to interrupts rather than to authorization.

The status is therefore set where it can be set before a render — the proxy's session check — and conceded where it cannot.

### Content Security Policy

CSP is a frontend responsibility because a strong policy needs a per-request nonce. The policy is written to [CSP Level 3](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP3/); `strict-dynamic` and nonce sources are that level's, and host-allowlist policies are not used.

- **The nonce is generated in the proxy** per request and set on both the request header and the response header, with `script-src 'nonce-<x>' 'strict-dynamic'`, `object-src 'none'`, and `base-uri 'self'`. Next propagates it to its own scripts. Inline scripts are not used.
- **`connect-src` allowlists first-party telemetry.** A missing entry silently breaks browser RUM, so the kitchen-sink page exercises it.
- **Static hardening is duplicated at the edge** as defence in depth: the directives that never vary are set by a Traefik middleware ([ADR-0305](0305-edge-auth-and-traffic-policy.md)) so every route gets them, not only Next pages.

### CSRF

CSRF protection applies to cookie-authenticated state changes. Bearer-token traffic is not browser-attached and is not exposed.

| Layer | Mechanism |
| --- | --- |
| Cookie | `SameSite=Lax`, `Secure`, `HttpOnly` ([ADR-0304](0304-identity-and-authorization.md)), which alone blocks the classic cross-site POST |
| Kratos self-service flows | Kratos's built-in anti-CSRF cookie and token, which the custom login UI must not disable |
| Server Actions | Next's built-in `Origin` and `Host` check with allowed origins pinned in config. Hand-rolled CSRF tokens are not added on top |
| Other cookie-authenticated mutations | rejected at the edge by an Origin allowlist ([ADR-0305](0305-edge-auth-and-traffic-policy.md)) |

### Lint, test, and gates

| Concern | Decision |
| --- | --- |
| Lint and format | **Biome only**, configured at repo root with `recommended` and `correctness` at error level plus strict additions including `noExplicitAny`, `noNonNullAssertion`, `useExhaustiveDependencies`, `noFloatingPromises`, and `noConsole`. ESLint is not installed |
| Unit and component tests | `bun test` with Testing Library and `happy-dom`, coverage thresholds per route group |
| Mocking in tests | MSW, an in-process double scoped to the test runner |
| End-to-end and visual | owned by [ADR-0601](0601-testing-strategy.md), driven by Playwright from the repo-root workspace. MSW and the development API mock are both forbidden there |
| Bundle size | per-route-group budgets fail the build on regression |
| Web vitals | Lighthouse CI on every PR, gating on **LCP < 2.5s**, **INP < 200ms**, **CLS < 0.1** on the mobile profile. Picked over WebPageTest and Calibre, which are hosted and so fail principle 3, and over bundle-size checks alone, which measure a proxy rather than the metric |
| Images and fonts | `next/image` and `next/font`. Raw `<img>` and `@font-face` are not used |

### Observability

The browser side of [ADR-0500](0500-observability.md) is wired here.

- OpenTelemetry web tracing and fetch instrumentation initialise from a client-only entry. Trace IDs propagate on outbound fetches, joining the same trace as the upstream services.
- **Grafana Faro** is the browser RUM agent. Web vitals, JS errors, and session traces forward through a Traefik-fronted ingest route on a vendor-neutral path to the collector's Faro receiver, landing in the same backends as services. Locally, where the dev server runs on the host with no edge, a dev-only route handler shims that path.
- **Faro's session tracking is configured in-memory**, not against `sessionStorage` or `localStorage`. The session id lives for the page's lifetime and is never persisted, which keeps the ops path clear of ePrivacy Art. 5(3) and so outside the consent gate ([ADR-0700](0700-analytics.md)). A persistent identifier on this path is a defect, not a feature.
- Server logs are structured JSON to stdout, enriched with the active trace id. `console.log` is lint-forbidden.
- The build embeds the version so traces and errors are version-attributable ([ADR-0103](0103-release-and-versioning.md)).

### Deferred capabilities

| Capability | Trigger | Seam | Cost if adopted late |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| i18n via `next-intl` | a second locale is committed to | ✓ all strings already live in one file per route group, so the migration is mechanical | every string added in the meantime has to be found, and the ones interpolated inline are the ones the extraction misses |
| A concrete feature-flag backend | a change needs to reach some users before others | ✓ application code already calls flags through the OpenFeature API against a noop provider, so only the provider changes | none of consequence — this is why the noop provider is wired on day one rather than the API being added later |
| Storybook and a hosted visual review UI | a component is edited by someone who does not run the app, or a visual regression reaches `master` twice | ⚠ **a bet.** Both consume the same committed components, which is an input format rather than a slot: nothing today renders a component in isolation, so adopting Storybook means writing the stories, not enabling a path | the component set has grown to whatever size made the kitchen-sink route stop working, and every story is written at once against components never designed to render standalone |

### Build and local development

The build produces standalone output and the container runs it under Bun, from a multi-stage Dockerfile whose runtime stage installs no Node ([ADR-0100](0100-language-and-runtime.md)). The image deploys through the shared service chart with route-group ingress paths in the environment's values.

Locally, the dev server runs against `cluster:base` and is reached through the edge. Work on authenticated surfaces uses the real Traefik, Kratos, and Oathkeeper with application data served by the API mock ([ADR-0600](0600-local-development-loop.md)). **The app's auth path is identical to production** — there is no development-only session, bypass, or environment-conditional branch in the session path.

## Consequences

### Positive

- The entire frontend story is one ADR plus citations.
- Server-first rendering keeps bundles small without sacrificing the design system.
- A single design-token source gives Figma-to-code parity.
- Biome-only is the smallest possible TypeScript toolchain: install, format, and lint in one binary.
- Form, fetch, and state primitives are app-wide, so route groups do not fork them.
- Browser traces continue the same trace id as upstream services.

### Negative / Risks

- **Biome lacks Next-specific lints.** Mitigated by `next build`, Lighthouse-CI, and the typed asset APIs. A different enforcement surface, not a behavioural gap.
- **Untitled UI source is vendored and committed**, so upgrading is a real PR. Mitigated by keeping the upstream layout verbatim, tracking bumps, and taking them yearly.
- **The OpenTelemetry web SDK is heavier than Faro alone.** Accepted; browser-to-service trace continuity is worth the bytes, and the perf gates keep it honest.
- **Deferring i18n risks a painful retrofit.** Mitigated by the one-file-per-route-group string layout.
- **A green axe run is not WCAG conformance.** Automated scanning catches only the machine-checkable subset of the success criteria; the rest — meaningful alt text, sensible reading order, whether a flow is completable by keyboard — is not detectable by a tool. The AA claim rests on the primitives being right and on the keyboard pass, and the gate only prevents regressions in the part a machine can see.
- **AA is claimed for first-party surfaces and refused for vendored ones.** A user who needs it meets an accessible product panel and an inaccessible Grafana. This is honest rather than good, and it is the direct cost of not building operator tooling.
- **The Lighthouse thresholds move with the speed of the machine that runs them.** A before/after is a comparison only when both sides were measured in one session; `environment.benchmarkIndex` in each report is what says whether they were.
- **The 401 page carries no `WWW-Authenticate` header**, which [RFC 9110](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-15.5.2) requires of a 401. No registered scheme names a login form, and a `Basic` challenge opens the browser's own credential dialog instead of it. Mitigated by the header having no consumer on this surface: the page is reached by a browser holding a cookie, not by a client that could act on a challenge. The form that carries information is [RFC 6750](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6750#section-3) `Bearer error="invalid_token"`, and it belongs to `/api`, where a client holds a refreshable token.
- **A Server Action is an implicit endpoint.** Its surface is defined by what the function accepts rather than by a spec, so it is limited to single-service mutations and never becomes an ad-hoc API for another consumer.

## Rules

- The frontend is one Next.js App-Router application. Pages Router is not used.
- Server Components are the default, and `"use client"` is added at the smallest interactivity boundary.
- Server Actions are permitted only for mutations against the route group's owning service. Cross-service mutations use the REST API and the workflow-handle pattern.
- Every route segment ships `loading.tsx` and `error.tsx`; every route-group root also ships `not-found.tsx`. `(CI: ci:lint)`
- First-party frontend code lives in the app. A `libs/ts/*` package is created only for a second consumer or a generated artifact.
- Server components fetch through the server-only fetcher; client components use TanStack Query over the generated SDKs. Direct `fetch` to service URLs is not used. `(CI: ci:lint)`
- Hand-written request and response types are not declared; only generated types are used, and form schemas are generated from the spec. `(CI: ci:gen)`
- Tailwind is the styling system, wired CSS-first with no config file. CSS Modules, CSS-in-JS, and inline `<style>` are not used in app code. `(CI: ci:lint)`
- Design tokens come from the committed Untitled UI token file. There is no JS token mirror, and tokens are not redefined per route group.
- Class composition uses `cx` and `sortCx`. Hand-written helpers are not added. `(CI: ci:lint)`
- Primitives are the vendored Untitled UI source, composed by explicit path and never duplicated.
- A primitive added under `src/components/` is added to the kitchen-sink page in the same PR, and that PR includes a keyboard-only pass of the new section.
- Every route group targets WCAG 2.2 AA. The Scalar console and vendored operator UIs are excluded, and the exclusion is stated rather than assumed. `(ref: WCAG 2.2 AA)`
- Every kitchen-sink section and every product journey is scanned with `@axe-core/playwright`; a `serious` or `critical` violation fails the merge. `(CI: e2e)`
- Colour contrast is verified against the design-token file, not per component. `(CI: e2e)`
- Icons come from the Untitled UI icon set. Another set requires an ADR amendment.
- Forms use react-hook-form and zod through the shared `<Form>` primitive.
- URL state uses `nuqs`; client-only state uses Zustand. Redux and MobX are not used. `(CI: ci:lint)`
- The proxy enforces the Kratos session on the authenticated route groups, and the frontend never mints, decodes, or validates JWTs. `(CI: lint:auth-inline)`
- An access denial is answered by its kind. No session redirects to the login flow carrying the current path and query; a session without permission renders in place, at the denied URL. `(ref: RFC 9110 §15.5)`
- Denials are raised once, in the fetch clients, and rendered by the framework's `unauthorized.tsx` and `forbidden.tsx`. A route carries no auth branch of its own, and the frontend computes no permission — the service decides ([ADR-0304](0304-identity-and-authorization.md)). `(ref: OWASP ASVS V4.1.1)`
- Browser calls to the API go through TanStack Query. A React boundary does not catch what an event handler throws, so a denial raised outside a render reaches no one.
- CSP is set in the proxy with a per-request nonce; inline scripts are not used and `connect-src` allowlists the telemetry ingest origin. `(ref: CSP Level 3)`
- CSRF rests on the SameSite cookie, Kratos's built-in protection, and the Server Actions Origin check. Hand-rolled CSRF tokens are not added.
- Biome is the only lint and format tool. ESLint is not installed. `(CI: ci:lint)`
- `bun test` covers unit and component tests. Vitest and Jest are not used.
- The frontend contains no development-only authentication code. `(CI: lint:auth-inline)`
- Browser observability is OpenTelemetry web plus Faro, exporting through the edge to the collector. Faro's session id is in-memory and per-page; the ops path writes nothing to client-side storage ([ADR-0700](0700-analytics.md)).
- Server logs are structured JSON to stdout. `(CI: ci:lint)`
- A client provider mounts at the route group that consumes it. Only providers that must wrap every route belong in the root layout.
- A browser SDK not needed for first paint is loaded with a dynamic `import()`. A static import decides when a bundle is downloaded and parsed, which deferring the call does not change — so nothing in the initial graph may statically import one.
- A redirect that can be decided before rendering is issued from the proxy, not from a page. Behind a `loading.tsx` boundary a page-level redirect ships as a rendered 200.
- Server components do not call the identity provider. Browser flows reach it through the edge ([ADR-0304](0304-identity-and-authorization.md)), which is the only path the network policy allows.
- Bundle budgets and the Lighthouse thresholds are merge gates.
- Images go through `next/image` and fonts through `next/font`. `(CI: ci:lint)`
- No i18n library is adopted; strings live in one file per route group.
- Feature flags go through the OpenFeature API with a noop provider.
- The container runs the standalone build under Bun, and installs no Node. `(CI: lint:node-scope)`
