# Heal a local kind cluster after a host reboot (ADR-0200).
#
# Docker's restart policy on the kind node is `unless-stopped`, so on daemon start
# (after a reboot) Docker replays the node container raw — the container comes back
# and its processes resume, but two things can be stale:
#
#   1. The docker-bridge gateway IP can change across a daemon restart. The host
#      edge glue (scripts/cluster-edge-glue.sh) points the frontend-dev
#      EndpointSlice at that address — the only host IP a pod can reach — so a
#      changed bridge gives a 502 at / until it is re-stamped.
#   2. Cilium's per-node datapath can be half-restored: pods then cannot egress
#      to the node/API, which cascades to CoreDNS (its `kubernetes` plugin never
#      goes ready) and every controller. A restart of the CNI + DNS rebuilds it.
#
# kind has no stop/start command of its own; docker stop+start on the node is the
# restart that re-runs the node's entrypoint cleanly. Idempotent and safe to run
# anytime the cluster looks wedged after a reboot. See docs/dev-loop.md
# ("After a reboot").
