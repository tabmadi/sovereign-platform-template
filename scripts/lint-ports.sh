# The local port registry gate (ADR-0205). Two services quietly sharing a port is a
# bind race that only surfaces when someone runs both — which is exactly the
# multi-service debugging case the registry exists to make possible. So it is
# checked here rather than discovered there.
#
# Three invariants:
#   1. Registered ports are unique.
#   2. Every service has an entry.
#   3. Each service's .mise.toml binds the port the registry assigns it. The two
#      have to agree: svc-apply.sh forwards to the registry's port and the service
#      binds .mise.toml's, so a drift between them fails at runtime as a connection
#      refused with no hint of why.
