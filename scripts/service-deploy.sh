# One-shot in-cluster deploy from the WORKING TREE (ADR-0200, ADR-0205) — the
# occasional "I need my uncommitted code in the cluster for edge/auth/e2e testing"
# case. No watch loop: the daily loop is native execution.
# Builds the image(s), loads them into the kind node, and helm-upgrades the same
# chart prod uses with the local values overlay.

# Two kinds of deployable, one chart. A Go SERVICE lives in services/<name> and
# builds server (and worker) images from one multi-stage Dockerfile parameterised by
# SERVICE/APP_CMD. An APP lives in apps/<name>, builds a single image from its own
# Dockerfile, and is a deployable exactly when it has a local values file — which is
# what keeps apps/admin out of this path (it ships inside the lowdefy chart).
# Everything after the build is identical, because both are the same Helm chart with
# the same values layout, so the split is confined to resolving the source and the
# build recipe.
#
# If the full tier (ArgoCD) manages this service, its auto-sync is paused first so
# self-heal does not revert your local image; re-enable with:
#   argocd app set local-service-<svc> --sync-policy automated   (or just cluster:up full)

# is my service CrashLooping" into a scavenger hunt.

# mise to resolve it — `mise tasks deps` only resolves from inside the service
# directory, and grepping the source of truth keeps this script explicit.
# Comment lines are excluded and the name must start with a letter: a prose
# reference to `dep:*` in a comment otherwise matches with an EMPTY component name,
# and dep-apply.sh then fails its usage guard on an argument nobody wrote.
