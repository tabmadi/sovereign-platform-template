# hubble-relay CrashLoopBackOff after a stop/start survivor: hubble-peer is backed
# by the cilium-agent pod itself (a hostPort :4244). With kubeProxyReplacement off,
# Cilium's eBPF LB still owns that ClusterIP and health-gates the backend from the
# EndpointSlice's ready condition. On a stop/start the agent goes briefly NotReady →
# endpoint ready:false → Cilium marks the sole backend Unhealthy (quarantined) and,
# because the LB state is restored from the PINNED bpf map, never re-reconciles it —
# `service-no-backend-response: reject` then turns every relay peer-notify into an
# instant ECONNREFUSED, wedging hubble-relay permanently (a fresh build never hits the
# race, so it only bites after the first stop/start). The chart hard-codes hubble-peer
# with no publishNotReadyAddresses and exposes no knob, so patch it: keeping the peer
# endpoint always-ready across agent restarts stops the quarantine at the source.
# (Persists across stop/start; re-applied on every cluster:full when this script re-runs.)
