# Documentation

Decisions are [ADRs](adr/README.md). Everything else is here, and earns its place by one rule:

> An ADR records a decision and its reasoning. A doc holds what an ADR must not — a **procedure to execute**, or **live state that changes without a decision changing**. Everything else is a link.

That is why there is no doc restating a stack choice, and why a runbook never argues for its own design.

**New here?** [reading-path](reading-path.md) is the ordered entry: ninety minutes to navigable, then what each role reads next.

## How this tree is laid out

Genre decides the directory, so a path states what kind of document it points at before the file is opened ([ADR-0001](adr/0001-documentation-and-output-conventions.md)).

| Path | Genre | Holds |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `adr/` | explanation + reference | the decisions |
| `guide/` | how-to | a procedure someone executes |
| `reference/` | reference | a lookup, a registry, or live state |
| `docs/*.md` | entry and canonical registries | the way in, and the documents the ADR set cites by name as the only place a thing is recorded |

The root is deliberately small: [reading-path](reading-path.md) and [dev-loop](dev-loop.md) are where a reader starts, and [operational-surface](operational-surface.md), [adoption-path](adoption-path.md), [tool-register](tool-register.md), and [security-baseline](security-baseline.md) are cited across the ADR set as the single home of the component inventory, the reduction order, the tool inventory, and the control index. A file earns the root by being one of those two things.

Topic lives in the filename, not in a directory. A directory holding one file is a directory that buys nothing, and a `runbook.md` repeated once per topic is four files an editor cannot tell apart.
