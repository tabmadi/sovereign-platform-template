# Untitled UI upstream tracking

This directory contains ports of Untitled UI primitives and design tokens. Per ADR-0014, the ports are committed source — not runtime-fetched.

| Tracked      | Version | Synced on      |
|--------------|---------|----------------|
| Untitled UI  | —       | not yet synced |
| lucide-react | 0.469.0 | 2026-05-20     |

Annual bump cadence. To re-sync:

1. Pull the latest Untitled UI Tailwind preset and primitive sources.
2. Diff against the tree under `tokens/` and `components/`.
3. Open a PR titled `feat(libs/ts/ui): bump Untitled UI to <version>`.
4. Update the table above and the date.
