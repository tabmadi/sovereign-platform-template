# ADR-0000: Platform Foundations

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-08-06
- **Deciders:** Platform team
- **Related:** [ADR-0001](0001-documentation-and-output-conventions.md), [ADR-0002](0002-tool-adoption.md)
- **Decides:** This platform sits at decomposition-high, sovereignty-maximal, and stakes-high, and every tool is admitted by ten anchored principles under a recorded comparison.

## Purpose

This ADR is referenced by every other ADR. It pins down:

1. **The thesis** — the platform's position on three axes, and what follows from it.
2. **The principles** every later decision must honour, each anchored to an external standard or marked local.
3. **The ADR process** — how decisions are made, recorded, changed.
4. **Prior art** — the sources this document's framing rests on.
5. **Vocabulary** used consistently across the rest of the documents.

No technology is chosen here. The rest of the ADRs choose technology.

## Thesis

This is a **self-hosted product platform**: its parts ship, scale, and fail independently, the owning organisation controls every piece of its infrastructure, and a wrong answer costs money. Every reusable choice is pre-decided, so work starts at "build features" rather than "pick stacks."

We state no target service count. A service count is an **outcome**, not a target: a number encodes a set of pressures, and once written down the number hides them. What follows names the pressures directly.

### The three axes

Architecture is forced by three largely independent questions. Position on each determines the decisions below; product category ("fintech", "B2B SaaS", "marketplace") determines almost nothing, because two products in the same category routinely sit at opposite ends of every axis.

| Axis | The question | Range |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **A — Decomposition pressure** | Must the parts ship, scale, or fail *independently*? | monolith → modular monolith → few services → many |
| **B — Operational sovereignty** | Who is permitted to run it? | managed cloud → hybrid → fully self-hosted |
| **C — Correctness stakes** | What does a wrong answer cost? | cosmetic → transactional → financial / regulated |

**Our position: A high, B maximal, C high.** Axis B is the distinguishing choice: most platforms at this position on A and C assume managed services underneath. This one does not, and that single decision generates more of the machinery in this repo than A and C combined.

Later ADRs cite this position rather than restating it. It changes here, in one line, and re-opens every ADR that rests on it.

**Positions on these axes are not maturity levels.** A monolith is a correct *terminal* state for most systems, not a waypoint. A higher position is not better; it is a more expensive answer to a pressure a system may not have. Where this repo does use levels — the CNCF project tiers in principle 4 — they are *recorded evidence about a dependency*, never a target for ourselves.

This follows Richards & Ford's treatment of architecture styles as **risk profiles rated against characteristics**, and refuses the numbered-ladder genre — CMMI and the maturity models after it — on the same grounds DORA/*Accelerate* refuses it: a ladder implies every rung is on the way to the next one, and these are not.

**The closest workable alternative is this position with axis B lower.** Several ADRs here answer questions a platform at that position would not face.

### Axis A: what forces decomposition

Service count is derived, not chosen. Each force below independently justifies a boundary.

| # | Force | The test |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Independent deploy cadence | Two parts must ship without coordinating a release |
| 2 | Number of teams | Teams block each other. Conway's law — teams, not headcount, not features |
| 3 | Failure isolation | One part failing must not take another down, as a *stated requirement* |
| 4 | Resource heterogeneity | Genuinely different scaling profiles — CPU-bound vs IO-bound vs memory-bound |
| 5 | Technology heterogeneity | A part must run on another runtime, per an [ADR-0100](0100-language-and-runtime.md) escape hatch |
| 6 | Compliance boundary | Data residency or audit scope cheaper to enforce structurally than by policy |

**A new service names the force that justifies it**, and the absence of all six means do not split. Nothing here obliges a high service count: the same machinery serves three deployables, and several ADRs get cheaper at that size.

### Capacity is a separate question from need

The axes say what a system *should* be. They say nothing about whether it can be operated.

> **Need determines what gets built. Capacity determines what can be run. The gap between them is the risk.**

Team size is therefore not a design driver — it is a budget. It does not tell a project to build thirty services; it tells the project what it can afford to operate. Stating a platform's target as a headcount conflates the two questions and produces a thesis whose halves never reconcile.

The capacity this position on axis B requires:

- **An always-on platform floor of a couple of dozen components** — gateway, GitOps, identity, authz, workflow, data, storage, observability, registry, forge, outbound mail. The floor is **fixed**: it does not shrink with fewer services. [`docs/operational-surface.md`](../operational-surface.md) is the inventory and the only place the components are counted.
- **Platform work as a primary responsibility, not a rotation.** A rotation optimises for the incident in front of it, and the floor's real cost is upgrades, drills, and rotations that nothing forces anyone to do this week. Deferring those is the most common way a self-hosted platform rots.
- **No Core component whose only competent operator is one person.** The floor must stay operable through a departure and an absence at the same time. This is a constraint on how knowledge is distributed, and each project computes its own lower bound from it and from its coverage obligations.

**No headcount is stated here, and none should be inferred.** The capacity a project needs depends on facts this repository does not know: coverage hours, existing operational skill, regulatory obligations, and tolerance for detection latency. What this repository can supply is the demand side — [`docs/operational-surface.md`](../operational-surface.md) carries the recurring obligation and failure-response requirement of every Core component, and summing that column against a project's own facts is how the number is derived rather than borrowed.

An important consequence: platform cost is fixed while application cost is variable, so **the fewer services run, the heavier the platform is proportionally.** At many services the ratio of application to platform workloads is comfortable; at a handful they are roughly equal. Fewer services therefore *strengthens* the case for a small, austere platform rather than relaxing it.

### Signals the floor has outgrown its capacity

Capacity is observed, not asserted. Any of the following, sustained, means the gap between need and capacity has opened:

- A Core component is more than one release behind its supported window, and no one has scheduled the upgrade.
- A restore drill or a break-glass rehearsal has been skipped twice in a row.
- An alert fired and nobody looked at it until the next working day — and that was not a deliberate choice recorded in an ADR.
- Onboarding a second competent operator for a Core component has been deferred for a full quarter.
- A Core component has no one who would volunteer to debug it during an incident.

The response is the one principle 3 permits: reduce the floor per [`docs/adoption-path.md`](../adoption-path.md), move down axis B, or add capacity. It is never to hold the floor and hope.

### Moving down axis B

Axis B is a genuine axis, not a virtue test. Sovereignty weaker than maximal is a legitimate position, recorded in an ADR of its own rather than drifted into. It is the right answer for a team that cannot staff the platform, and a better one than holding the self-hosted floor and hoping.

**Axis B is the axis this platform is least coupled to.** Moving down it swaps *operators*, not architecture. Unchanged by a managed swap: the ADR set, OpenAPI contracts and codegen, the service template, the Helm and GitOps trees, policy-as-admission, repo layout, release and versioning, and the local dev loop.

Concessions are ranked by **capacity returned per unit of sovereignty conceded**, rather than by ease. [`docs/adoption-path.md`](../adoption-path.md) carries the ranked list and is the only place it is ordered, the same way [`docs/operational-surface.md`](../operational-surface.md) is the only place components are counted. Outbound email is first and Kubernetes is last, for reasons that document states per row.

A **hybrid** position is legitimate and common: self-host the orchestrator and the stateless platform, take managed Postgres, object storage, email, and paging. That removes most of the pager burden while keeping the parts whose sovereignty usually motivated the choice. Reversal is a migration per component in either direction, so the position is chosen deliberately.

A system that has taken most of that list is no longer at A-high/B-maximal, and the machinery here may exceed its need.

**Conceding the operator is not the only way to get smaller, and the three ways are not interchangeable.** A capability may also be *deferred* — removed while its seam stays, so it returns as a chart — or *conceded outright*, which is a bet paid for in application code. [`docs/adoption-path.md`](../adoption-path.md) separates the three, orders them, and states where a reduction stops being a smaller instance of this platform and becomes a different one.

### What follows from the thesis

- **Per-service cost compounds.** A choice that adds RAM, CI time, or onboarding cost per service is multiplied by the service count. At many services this is existential; at few it is an efficiency — but it is never free.
- **One way to do things.** When a tool or pattern is picked, it is picked for everyone. Per-service deviation requires a new ADR.

The rest of what follows is stated as principles below, since each one also decides tools.

## Principles

The principles below decide everything else in this repo. Every later ADR is checked against them. If a decision violates a principle, the principle wins or the principle is changed *in this document* — never silently waived.

**The test for being on this list:** a principle earns its place only if it has **rejected something we wanted**. Anything that cannot name a casualty is a virtue statement, not a criterion, and does not belong here.

Each principle is **anchored** to an external standard, or explicitly marked **local** where none applies. The distinction is load-bearing: a borrowed criterion survives re-litigation; a house rule gets re-argued every year. A reader should be able to tell which is which without asking.

### Selection — how a tool gets in

**1. Configuration lives in the repository, not in the component.** Dashboards, alert rules, identity schemas, OAuth2 clients, authz models. If the source of truth is the running system's database and the UI is the editor, it is invisible to review, invisible to Argo, and unreproducible from git.

- *Anchor:* [OpenGitOps](https://opengitops.dev/) principles 1 (*Declarative*) and 2 (*Versioned and Immutable*), v1.0.0, CNCF GitOps Working Group — **extended one level out**. OpenGitOps governs the system state a GitOps agent reconciles; we apply the same requirement to each platform component's own configuration. The extension is ours; the principle is not.
- *Rejected:* SigNoz, OpenObserve, Coroot ([ADR-0501](0501-operator-uis-and-dashboards.md)), Zitadel ([ADR-0304](0304-identity-and-authorization.md)).
- *What it costs:* an observability stack of several components instead of one product ([ADR-0500](0500-observability.md)). This principle is expensive and is applied anyway. That is what makes it a principle.

**2. The always-on floor is the budget.** A simpler tool covering 90% of the need beats a richer tool that needs a dedicated operator. Components are tiered Core / Scale / Opt-in in [`docs/operational-surface.md`](../operational-surface.md); a component joins Core only when no existing Core component covers its concern.

**The floor is measured in concerns, not in charts.** Two components one person operates as one concern cost less than one component nobody has debugged, which is why the tiering asks what a component obliges rather than what it weighs — and why [`docs/operational-surface.md`](../operational-surface.md) carries a recurring obligation and a failure-response requirement per row rather than a component count.

- *Anchor:* Team Topologies (Skelton & Pais), **cognitive load as the sizing unit**. The direction is **local**: [*thinnest viable platform*](https://teamtopologies.com/key-concepts-content/what-is-a-thinnest-viable-platform-tvp) bounds what a platform imposes on the teams building on it, and this principle bounds what it imposes on the people running it. The unit is borrowed; the constraint is ours, and a platform can satisfy one and fail the other.
- *Rejected:* GitLab CE, Coroot, every second CI system.

**3. Operational sovereignty — we run it ourselves.** Not "self-host by default" — this is **axis B at maximum**, a hard constraint rather than a preference with an exit. Every component runs on infrastructure the owning organisation controls, and managed services are not adopted to reclaim operational budget.

- *Anchor:* axis B, above. The position is ours; the axis is not.
- *Rejected:* every managed service, including where one would plainly be cheaper.

*Why there is no soft exit.* The tempting version of this principle moves components to managed when the platform crowds out feature work. That inverts the causality the thesis states: **capacity is the thing to change, not the constraint.**

Where sovereignty is genuinely binding — data residency, regulatory control, cost predictability, or a refusal to depend on third-party operators — a capacity shortfall is resolved by hiring. Where it is not binding, the position on axis B is different and is recorded in its own ADR, not treated as an escape hatch inside this one.

*Consequence, stated plainly.* Axis B at maximum removes a set of services that are otherwise invisible defaults: transactional email delivery ([ADR-0307](0307-outbound-email.md)), alert routing ([ADR-0502](0502-alerting-and-on-call.md)), source control and CI ([ADR-0102](0102-source-control-and-ci.md)), image registry ([ADR-0105](0105-image-registry.md)), object storage ([ADR-0200](0200-cluster-topology.md)), and single sign-on across platform consoles ([ADR-0304](0304-identity-and-authorization.md)). Each is a first-class decision here rather than a signup. Some — outbound email deliverability in particular — carry costs that engineering effort cannot fully retire.

*Where axis B is not maximal.* Maximum is a position, not a claim of zero external dependencies. Five remain, each recorded rather than discovered later.

| Dependency | Why it stays | Blast radius if it fails |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Compute and network provider | [ADR-0200](0200-cluster-topology.md) runs on plain instances, which someone provisions. Sovereignty is over the *stack*, not the metal | total for that environment. Mitigated by the provider-neutral bootstrap, which is what makes the substrate replaceable |
| Public ACME certificate authority | [ADR-0200](0200-cluster-topology.md) issues wildcards through cert-manager against a public CA | renewals fail, with the certificate lifetime as the buffer. A private CA is the exit, at the cost of distributing a trust anchor |
| DNS registrar and authoritative DNS | the domain is delegated, DNS-01 needs a provider API, and outbound mail needs `PTR` delegation ([ADR-0307](0307-outbound-email.md)) | edge unreachable, issuance blocked, and mail undeliverable. This is the least substitutable item on the list — the registrar half cannot be self-hosted at all, and the zone data is public, so sovereignty has little to buy here |
| Upstream package and image sources | Go modules, npm, Helm charts, and base images are fetched from where their publishers put them | builds fail; running does not. Digest pins ([ADR-0104](0104-supply-chain-security.md)) make what already runs immune |
| Escalation and paging | no mature self-hosted layer exists ([ADR-0502](0502-alerting-and-on-call.md)) | deferred rather than depended on. Nothing pages |

None of these is a soft exit from principle 3. Each is a dependency at a layer the platform does not claim to own, or a recorded concession with a named cost. A dependency that is not on this list and not decided in an ADR is a defect.

**4. Spend novelty by exit cost, not by taste.** Novelty is a fixed budget, and *where* it is spent matters as much as how much. Be adventurous where abandonment costs days — CI, observability query layers, registries, policy engines. Be conservative where it costs months and customer data — object storage, databases, the message bus. "Actively maintained" is adequate assurance for the first class and inadequate for the second.

- *Anchor:* McKinley, [*Choose Boring Technology*](https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology) — innovation tokens as a budget rather than a preference. The budget is *about three*, and this platform holds more young components than that.
- *Rejected:* Garage (too young for the data plane, and single-vendor), Encore (a data-plane-shaped lock-in wearing control-plane clothing).
- *Accepted on the same rule:* Talos, Kyverno, zot, Prism, Lowdefy — all young, all cheap to leave.
- Licence, governing body, and project maturity (CNCF tier, Thoughtworks Radar ring) are **recorded** per tool but do **not** veto. Provenance is evidence about exit cost, not a rule of its own.

**What makes the count affordable is the exit-cost rule, not the count.** McKinley's budget is a proxy for recovery cost; this principle measures recovery cost directly, which is what the proxy loses when it counts a cheap exit and an expensive one as equal tokens.

**Every young component carries a named fallback and an observable trigger in its owning ADR.** A novel choice with a recorded runner-up is a deferral; one without is a bet.

| Component | Fallback | Trigger that promotes the fallback | Owning ADR |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cilium | Calico in its eBPF dataplane | a committed traffic-splitting delivery requirement, which is the one capability Cilium lacks | [ADR-0206](0206-cluster-networking.md) |
| OpenFGA | SpiceDB, equal on capability | the `Checker` seam makes this a library, model, and chart change; the trigger is a governance change at the vendor | [ADR-0304](0304-identity-and-authorization.md) |
| Lowdefy | the `(admin)` route group in the existing frontend | upstream releases stop for two quarters, or a runtime security advisory goes unanswered for one | [ADR-0401](0401-internal-admin.md) |
| Prism | `muonsoft/openapi-mock` | the vendored container proves unacceptable, gated on demonstrating OpenAPI 3.1 support | [ADR-0600](0600-local-development-loop.md) |
| zot | CNCF Distribution | zot's registry conformance regresses, or its object-storage backend stops tracking the OCI referrers API | [ADR-0105](0105-image-registry.md) |
| Talos | Debian stable converged by provisioning, with Kubernetes installed separately | the immutable-node model blocks a workload the platform commits to running | [ADR-0200](0200-cluster-topology.md) |
| Kyverno | the CI lint layer already covering the same rule classes, at a weaker layer | a cluster-wide admission outage traced to the webhook, twice | [ADR-0203](0203-policy-enforcement.md) |
| SeaweedFS | any S3-compatible store, reached through the same client | the S3 layer fails a checksum round-trip that the documented escapes do not close | [ADR-0207](0207-cluster-storage.md) |

**SeaweedFS is the only young component on the expensive-exit side**, which is why its row names a fallback reachable through an unchanged client rather than a migration. The other component holding customer data is PostgreSQL, which is the boring choice by any reading.

**5. One primitive per concern.** No parallel mechanisms for the same problem: one workflow engine ([Temporal](0302-temporal.md)), one queue model, one deploy mechanism, one manifest tree. Durable, multi-step, or cross-service async is a Temporal workflow; a trivial best-effort job may use the sanctioned transactional-outbox path — the same concern served by one lighter primitive, not a competing engine.

- *Anchor:* **local** — falls out of principle 2. Every parallel mechanism is a second runbook.
- *Rejected:* Woodpecker, Tekton, Argo Workflows, Jenkins (all viable; all a second system beside the forge).

**6. Two languages, and no ambient runtime.** Go and TypeScript. Escape hatches (Rust, Python) require their own ADR with a measured need. No tool may assume a runtime that is not pinned in `.mise.toml`.

- *Anchor:* [12-Factor II](https://12factor.net/dependencies) — *"A twelve-factor app never relies on implicit existence of system-wide packages"* — for the ambient-runtime half. The two-language cap itself is **local**.
- *Rejected:* Semgrep and sqlfluff (both need ambient Python), which is why static analysis is `ast-grep` and SQL lint is `sqruff`.

**7. No adoption without a recorded comparison.** A tool with no recorded comparison against its alternatives is an assumption, not a decision.

- *Anchor:* **local** — principle 4 applied to the record. Depth is set by exit cost, and [ADR-0002](0002-tool-adoption.md) defines the three tiers and what each owes: a full table where abandonment costs months and customer data, a short one where it costs weeks, a register line where it costs days.
- *Rejected:* nothing directly — this is the process gate that makes principles 1–6 enforceable rather than aspirational.

### Construction — how the system is built once a tool is in

**8. Local–prod parity at the manifest and API layer.** Topology may differ; charts, code, and commands do not.

- *Anchor:* [12-Factor X](https://12factor.net/dev-prod-parity) — *"resists the urge to use different backing services between development and production."*
- *Rejected:* Docker Compose for local development — a second definition of the system, whose drift from the real manifests fails at runtime rather than build time.

**9. Generated code is committed and drift-checked in CI.** Drift is caught in review, not at runtime.

- *Anchor:* **local** — principle 1 applied to generated artifacts.
- *Rejected:* generation at build, deploy, or run time.

**10. Service boundaries are HTTP/OpenAPI.** Services compose through generated clients — never shared code, never a shared database, never a direct workflow call into another service's namespace.

- *Anchor:* Fowler, [*IntegrationDatabase*](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/IntegrationDatabase.html) — a shared database *"becomes a point of coupling between the applications that access it… a deep coupling that significantly increases the risk involved in changing those applications."*
- *Rejected:* shared libraries and shared schemas as integration mechanisms.

## ADR process

### How an ADR must be written

Two rules that are easily mistaken for principles. They are not selection criteria — they govern *how a decision is recorded*, and so they live here.

**Decisions are unambiguous.** When an ADR says "do X," there is no "or Y in some cases." Conditional behaviour is expressed as a **measurable trigger**, not a judgement call. An ADR that requires taste to apply has not finished deciding.

**No "temporary."** Anything described as temporary becomes permanent. Either commit to a solution, or defer it behind a hard trigger — and a deferral is only complete when three things are written down:

| Field | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| **Trigger** | An *observable* condition. "When we grow" is not a trigger; "when Prometheus exceeds its retention window" is |
| **Seam** | Whether the slot already exists for the thing to drop into |
| **Cost if adopted late** | What the delay buys, and what it risks |

A deferral **with a seam** is additive — adopting it later changes configuration, not structure. A deferral **without a seam** is a *bet*, and is labelled as one in the owning ADR. The two look identical in a backlog and are different in a review.

[`docs/operational-surface.md`](../operational-surface.md) holds the Core / Scale / Opt-in tiers this applies to, and what is deferred.

### When to write an ADR

Write an ADR when a decision will be **load-bearing for more than one service** or **hard to reverse**. Examples:

- Choosing or replacing a platform-wide tool (database, gateway, IdP, observability backend).
- Defining a cross-service contract (auth headers, error format, workflow handle shape).
- Sanctioning a per-service exception (a Rust service, a non-default storage class, a long-running workflow).

Single-service implementation details do **not** get an ADR. They live in the service's README.

### Statuses

- **Proposed** — open for review. Linked in a PR, and binding once accepted.
- **Accepted** — merged. Binding on all services.
- **Superseded by ADR-XXXX** — replaced by a newer decision, kept for history.
- **Amended by ADR-XXXX** — modified in part. The amendment cites which sections it changes.

There is no `Rejected` or `Draft` status. Rejected proposals are closed PRs, not committed files.

**Scope:** the last two statuses belong to a project generated from this template, which is a living system with real history. **This template's own set carries no history** — every ADR here reads `Accepted`, carries the date the set was written, and one that must change is rewritten in place ([ADR-0001](0001-documentation-and-output-conventions.md)).

### Structure, numbering, and prose

[ADR-0001](0001-documentation-and-output-conventions.md) owns all three: section order, the blocks-of-a-hundred numbering, and the density rules.

One rule belongs here instead, because it is a selection criterion rather than a style: **the comparison table in *Considered options* is mandatory** (principle 7). [ADR-0002](0002-tool-adoption.md) sets its depth per tier. A long deep-dive belongs in the PR discussion, not the ADR.

### Who decides

The platform team. One reviewer with platform-team approval is enough for an ADR to merge. Disagreement is resolved by a 24-hour async comment window; unresolved disagreements escalate to a synchronous decision call.

## Prior art

This ADR borrows its framing rather than inventing it. Where a decision here has an external anchor, it is cited at the point of use; these are the sources the structure itself rests on.

| Source | What this document takes from it |

| DORA / *Accelerate* | Capability models over maturity ladders |

### 12-Factor conformance

[12-Factor](https://12factor.net/) predates Kubernetes, and several of its factors are satisfied by the orchestrator rather than by any decision of ours. Two of them anchor a principle above and are cited at the point of use; the rest are recorded here so a reader who knows the canon can find the corresponding decision without reading the set.

| Factor | Decided in | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- |
| I — Codebase | [ADR-0101](0101-monorepo.md), [ADR-0201](0201-gitops.md) | conforms — one repo, one SHA through every environment |
| II — Dependencies | principle 6 above; [ADR-0100](0100-language-and-runtime.md) | conforms — anchors principle 6 |
| III — Config | [ADR-0202](0202-secrets.md), [ADR-0205](0205-environment-parity.md) | conforms — the env contract is identical in every tier; values come from SOPS-derived Secrets |
| IV — Backing services | [ADR-0300](0300-data.md), [ADR-0302](0302-temporal.md), [ADR-0205](0205-environment-parity.md) | conforms — the provider may differ per tier, the wire contract may not |
| V — Build, release, run | [ADR-0103](0103-release-and-versioning.md), [ADR-0201](0201-gitops.md) | conforms — immutable SHA tags, digest-pinned production, no moving tags |
| VI — Processes | [ADR-0200](0200-cluster-topology.md), [ADR-0401](0401-internal-admin.md) | conforms — the application tier is stateless; state is Postgres, object storage, and Temporal |
| VII — Port binding | — | n/a — a Kubernetes `Service` owns it. There is no decision to make |
| VIII — Concurrency | [ADR-0204](0204-resource-management.md) | conforms, scoped — scale-out is opt-in on a measured signal, never a template default |
| IX — Disposability | [ADR-0302](0302-temporal.md), [ADR-0204](0204-resource-management.md) | conforms — cited at the worker-drain rule |
| X — Dev/prod parity | principle 8 above; [ADR-0205](0205-environment-parity.md), [ADR-0600](0600-local-development-loop.md) | conforms, scoped — anchors principle 8; scale and inner-loop stand-ins may differ |
| XI — Logs | [ADR-0500](0500-observability.md) | conforms — structured JSON to stdout, routed by the collector |
| XII — Admin processes | [ADR-0300](0300-data.md), [ADR-0401](0401-internal-admin.md) | conforms, scoped — same image and release, never a host shell |

### Standards deliberately not adopted

Principle 7 applies to standards as much as to tools: one with no recorded comparison is an assumption. These were weighed and refused, and the reason is recorded so the question is not reopened for free. Refusal here means *not adopted as a normative reference*, never that the underlying concern is unaddressed.

| Standard | Why not |
| --- | --- |
| **ISO 27001**, **SOC 2** | Certification frameworks describing an audited management system, not design guidance. The controls they examine are already decided — supply chain ([ADR-0104](0104-supply-chain-security.md)), secrets ([ADR-0202](0202-secrets.md)), retention ([ADR-0301](0301-data-lifecycle-privacy.md)), access ([ADR-0304](0304-identity-and-authorization.md)). What adopting one adds is an evidence programme and an auditor, which is a commercial decision about who the product sells to, not an architectural one |
| **NIST SSDF** (SP 800-218) | A crosswalk over practices [ADR-0104](0104-supply-chain-security.md) already decides through SLSA provenance, cosign signing, and admission verification. Adopting it produces a mapping table to maintain and changes no control |
| **PCI DSS** | **Scope-triggered rather than refused.** The platform stores no cardholder data; a payment integration hands off to a provider. A project that takes card data directly brings PCI scope with it, and that changes [ADR-0300](0300-data.md) and [ADR-0301](0301-data-lifecycle-privacy.md) rather than this document |
| **TUF** | Solves repository compromise, rollback, and key distribution for a public update system with untrusted mirrors and many unknown consumers. This registry serves one estate, pinned by digest and verified at admission ([ADR-0104](0104-supply-chain-security.md), [ADR-0105](0105-image-registry.md)). Its threat model is not ours |
| **AsyncAPI** | There is no async wire contract to describe. Durable async is Temporal workflows typed in Go ([ADR-0302](0302-temporal.md)) and the outbox is in-process. It would document a message bus this platform does not run |
| **OAM**, **Score**, **Backstage** | Abstraction layers over Kubernetes for teams who should not read manifests. Principle 2 bounds the floor, and [ADR-0201](0201-gitops.md)'s shared chart already *is* the abstraction. A second one over it is a layer with no reader |
| **CIS Kubernetes Benchmark** | Written against a general Kubernetes with a mutable node. Talos removes most of what it audits — no SSH, no kubelet config file, no host package manager ([ADR-0200](0200-cluster-topology.md)) — so a large share of its findings are not-applicable rather than passing. Workload hardening is asserted directly through Pod Security Standards instead |

[ADR-0001](0001-documentation-and-output-conventions.md) records one further refusal on the same basis: [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119) keyword grades, rejected because every Rule here is binding and a `SHOULD` tier invites negotiation.

## Vocabulary

Used consistently across all ADRs. If a term is ambiguous in a later ADR, this glossary wins.

**Four words carry a second, unrelated sense elsewhere in the repository.** Both senses are correct, and the subject resolves which is meant.

| Word | Glossary sense | The other sense |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **floor** | the guaranteed minimum of the platform or a primitive | *baseline* in a load-test run is the reference measurement a later run is compared against ([`docs/guide/performance-runbook.md`](../guide/performance-runbook.md)), and [`docs/security-baseline.md`](../security-baseline.md) is the index of controls |
| **ceiling** | the point at which an approach stops working, stated as a trigger | a container's `limits` field, which is a scheduler value ([ADR-0204](0204-resource-management.md)) |
| **trigger** | the observable condition that makes a deferred capability due | a *threshold* is a number whose doubling would change the decision ([ADR-0001](0001-documentation-and-output-conventions.md)). A threshold is often what a trigger tests, and the two are not interchangeable: one is a number, the other is a condition |
| **first-class** | served by the default path rather than by a special case beside it | *native execution* is a service run as a host process rather than in a container ([ADR-0600](0600-local-development-loop.md)) |

- **Axis position** — this platform's load-bearing assumption, set in *Thesis* above: **A high, B maximal, C high**. An ADR cites the axis position rather than restating a service count or a headcount, so it changes in that one place.
- **Seam** — a pre-built slot a deferred capability drops into without restructuring. A deferral with a seam is additive; one without is a bet.
- **Anchor** — the external standard a principle rests on. A principle without one is marked **local**.
- **Trigger** — the observable condition that makes a deferred capability due. A deferral states one, or it is indefinite.
- **Day one** — present in the first deployment rather than deferred behind a trigger.
- **Floor** — the guaranteed minimum. Of the platform, the components running before any service is added; of a library or a primitive, what it supplies before composition. A floor is not a target.
- **Ceiling** — the point at which an approach stops working. A ceiling is stated as a trigger, never as a limit quietly tolerated.
- **Escape hatch** — a sanctioned, bounded exception to a default, naming what is permitted and where. An unbounded one is a second default.
- **Island** — a bounded region running something other than the platform default: a language, a runtime, or a signal store. An island pins its own tools and does not widen the exception around it.
- **Load-bearing** — a fact the decision rests on. Remove it and the decision changes; a fact that survives removal is context.
- **First-class** — served by the default path rather than by a special case beside it.
- **Hot path** — the per-request code path. Cost added here is paid on every request.
- **Blast radius** — what a failure or a compromise reaches before something stops it.
- **A signal with no reader** — an output whose only value is that someone else consults it, produced where nobody does. It is cost without benefit, and the test is to name the reader: a SemVer bump names a pinner ([ADR-0103](0103-release-and-versioning.md)), a keyless signature names a stranger verifying without the signer's cooperation ([ADR-0104](0104-supply-chain-security.md)), and an abstraction layer names whoever must not read the manifests underneath. Where the named reader does not exist here, the signal is refused and the escape hatch is the reader arriving.
- **Break-glass** — the documented procedure for bypassing a normal control during an incident, written down before it is needed.
- **Service** — a deployable unit under `services/<name>/` owning a slice of business state and an OpenAPI surface. May include HTTP server, Temporal worker, and migrations.
- **Frontend app** — the single Next.js application under `apps/frontend/`. Route groups separate audiences; the deploy unit is one app.
- **Platform component** — infrastructure software the services depend on (Postgres, Temporal server, gateway, IdP, observability stack). Lives under `infra/helm/platform/`.
- **Library** — shared code under `libs/go/<name>/` or `libs/ts/<name>/`. Has no business state.
- **Generated client** — code under `libs/{go,ts}/sdks/<service>/` produced from a service's OpenAPI spec. Committed to the repo.
- **Workflow / Activity** — Temporal terms. See ADR-0302.
- **Authz-relevant mutation** — a state change that affects who can see or modify a resource. See ADR-0304.
- **Affected** — in CI, the set of services and apps a PR's diff influences. See ADR-0101.
- **Environment** — one of `dev`, `staging`, `prod`. Each is a single cluster on day one. See ADR-0200.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Newcomers (humans or LLMs) read one short document and have the platform's worldview.
- Later ADRs do not relitigate principles; they cite them.
- Coherence is a checkable property: an ADR either follows the principles or amends them.

### Negative / Risks

- **The axis positions are the load-bearing assumption.** A system that sits materially lower on axis A or B needs several later ADRs re-evaluated. Acknowledged, not mitigated — *Moving down axis B* above exists so that re-evaluation is guided rather than improvised.
- **The list is longer than most people hold in their head.** The mitigation is that most are anchored to standards a reader may already know, and that every one names what it rejected — a criterion with a casualty is easier to recall than an abstraction.
- Strong opinions reduce flexibility. A team that needs to deviate justifies it in a new ADR.

## Rules

### Process

- An ADR exists for every decision that binds more than one service or is hard to reverse.
- An ADR follows the structure, numbering, and prose rules of [ADR-0001](0001-documentation-and-output-conventions.md).
- **No tool is adopted without a recorded comparison against its alternatives** (principle 7). The comparison is a table with prose cells, not a scoring grid, at the depth [ADR-0002](0002-tool-adoption.md) sets for that tool's tier. `(CI: lint:tool-register)`
- Every young component carries a named fallback and an observable trigger in its owning ADR. A novel adoption without one is a bet, and is labelled one.
- An accepted ADR is binding on every service. Per-service deviation requires a new ADR.
- A decision is unambiguous: no "or Y in some cases" without a measurable trigger.
- Nothing is "temporary." Either commit, or defer behind a hard trigger — and record the trigger, whether a **seam** exists, and the cost of adopting late. A deferral without a seam is a **bet** and is labelled one.

### Selection

- Configuration lives in this repo, not in the component. UI-only state is not allowed for anything reconciled into a cluster, and not for a component's own configuration either.
- Platform components are tiered Core / Scale / Opt-in in [`docs/operational-surface.md`](../operational-surface.md). A component joins Core only when no existing Core component covers its concern; a Scale variant replaces its Core counterpart only on the measured trigger documented there.
- Every component runs on infrastructure we control. Managed services are not adopted to reclaim operational budget.
- Novelty is spent by exit cost: freely where abandonment costs days, conservatively where it costs months and customer data.
- One primitive per concern. Parallel mechanisms for the same problem require an ADR that retires the incumbent.
- Go and TypeScript only. No tool may assume a runtime that is not pinned in `.mise.toml`. `(CI: lint:node-scope)`
- Licence, governing body, and project maturity are **recorded** for every component and **do not veto** a choice.

### Construction

- Local and production differ in topology only. Charts, code, and commands do not diverge.
- Generated code is committed and drift-checked in CI. `(CI: ci:gen)`
- Service-to-service communication is HTTP via generated OpenAPI clients. Shared databases, shared code, and cross-service workflow calls are forbidden. `(CI: ci:lint)`
- Local development uses the same Helm charts, container images, and commands as production. Topology may differ; interface may not.
